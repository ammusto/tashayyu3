            <h2>About The Project</h2>
            <p>The idea to put tashayyu3 together emerged after a discussion with my friend who was working through Zaydī texts. It is well-known that Shīʿī and other texts are excluded from or significantly underrepresented in the primary searchable corpuse of medieval Arabic texts, al-Maktaba al-Shāmila. There are other corpora, including the various Shīʿī versions of al-Maktaba al-Shāmila, as well as shialibraryonline, but they are dispersed and some lack certain search capabilities. Texts from these and other corpora have been gathered into the OpenITI/KITAB meta corpus, but have remained there on Github, inaccessible to the lay researcher. Surprisingly, there have been no efforts to make these texts easily accessible (readable, searchable, etc.) to those without technical skills. In light of this, I have put together this stop-gap measure developped over the course of a week or so, a light-weight web application to hopefully encourage more large-scale efforts to produce a more robust toolset for searching, reading, and analyzing these texts on an accessible platform.</p>
