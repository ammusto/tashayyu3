1,al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī,الحارث بن أسد المحاسبي,al-Muḥāsibī,المحاسبي,243,"Arnaldez, R., “al-Muḥāsibī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Consulted online on 24 July 2022","<p> Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥārith (d. 243/857), Muslim mystic.
<p>Amongst these, he is the one whose contemplation is the most psychological; it is marked by attachment to moral values, and not by a more or less extreme theological system. In this sense, L. Massignon has legitimately described his mystical doctrine as “more circumspect” (<em>Passion</em> 2, i, 120). He proceeds from introspection and confines himself to analysing and developing it in its relations with the circumstances of life. It is no doubt this which explains his cognomen of muḥāsibī, signifying “he who calculates his actions”, in other words, one who practises examination of conscience; many Ṣūfis considered this practice dangerous, in that it tends to make the man the judge of his actions, a role which belongs only to God. Al-Muḥāsibī was furthermore reproached for this practice by Ibn Ḥanbal . It will be observed below how he avoids this danger and this criticism. It should also be noted that he does not confine himself to subjective descriptions of states of conscience, but that he examines them with his reason and with a “concern for precise philosophical definitions”, as noted by L. Massignon (<em>Essai</em>, revised ed., 242); furthermore, he always relies on intellectual meditation on texts of the qurʾān and the prophetic tradition. Included among his works is an epistle concerning the quiddity and meaning of intelligence (<em>Risālat māhiyyat al-ʿaql wa-maʿnāh</em>). Thus his thought has evolved into a “science of hearts”. It is in this sense that he is opposed to the excessively abstract rationalism of the Muʿtazilīs, affirming the uncreated simplicity of the divine Word while teaching that the letters of the qurʾān are created.
<p>Born in Baṣra, al-Muḥāsibī came at a very early stage to Baghdād, where he spent the greater part of his life and where he died. Nothing is known of his life other than that he devoted it to teaching. But from 232/846 onward, he was obliged to abandon his teaching, confronted by the blind reaction of the Sunnīs who did not understand his use of dialectic in opposing the Muʿtazila. It was at this point that Ibn Ḥanbal began to attack him.
<p>Among his numerous works, listed by L. Massignon in his <em>Essai</em> (243-4), there are two which have been edited and which deserve particular attention.
<p> “The book of observance of the rights of God” (<em>K. al-Riʿāya li-ḥuqūq Allāh</em>) has been edited by Margaret Smith (London 1941) who writes in her introduction that this book “is his masterpiece, by far the greatest, as it is the longest and most comprehensive of his writings. It is written in the form of counsels, given to a disciple in reply to his questions, to enable believers to find the way of life in which they could render to God the service which is his due” (pp. xvi-xvii). Al-Muḥāsibī reveals what the soul of a believer should be, to conform with what God wills it to be. It will be noted in particular that he speaks of pious fear (<em>taqwā</em>) and of repentance (<em>tawba</em>). He examines, for example, fear at the level of the members of the body, in order to avoid the offences which they are capable of committing, and fear at the level of the conscience (<em>fi ’l-ḍamīr</em>), and he shows that fear engenders waraʿ, which consists in avoiding all that is displeasing to God. The study of the “repentant ones” (<em>al-tawwābūn</em>) is very detailed. In this context, al-Muḥāsibī distinguishes three degrees in human conduct. First there is the young man who has been brought up well, who inevitably makes some mistakes, but who returns at once to the purity of his heart which God protects because He loves him, since the one who loves (<em>al-ḥabīb</em>) is unwilling to lose the one whom he loves (<em>al-maḥbūb</em>). Then there is the case of the man who, from his ignorance, returns to God. God gives him the resolution (<em>al-ʿazm</em>) to observe His Commandments in the future. But the soul which tends towards evil continues in its efforts. Then God helps the man who persists in his wrong-doing (<em>al-muṣirr fī dhanbih</em>); the awareness that he has of the promises of Paradise and the threat of Hell is insufficient to detach him from worldly pleasures. He is in need of something “which unties in his heart the knots of persistence in evil, in such a way that he may return to his Lord in repentance of his offence”. This result is to be achieved by fear (<em>khawf</em>) and by hope (<em>rajā</em>), which are evidently to be understood here as gifts and blessings of God.
<p>Al-Muḥāsibī wrote a particularly fine book, the <em>Kitāb al-Tawahhum</em>, which André Roman has translated and which he presents as a “vision of the last things”. It could be said that it is a Dies Irae which ends up in an In Paradisum.
<p>In his <em>Essai</em>, Massignon has translated or summarised several passages drawn from manuscripts of al-Muḥāsibī. In a kind of autobiography, al-Muḥāsibī shows himself troubled by the divisions which rend the Muslim community. He insists that salvation can only be attained through pious fear, the observation of canonical obligations and <em>waraʿ</em>: abstaining from that which God forbids, acting in all things only for God and taking the Prophet as a model. L. Massignon also quotes the opening passage of <em>al-Faṣl fi ’l-maḥabba</em>, on Love, where al-Muḥāsibī shows that all initiative comes from God through a kind of anticipatory grace, and this constitutes a response to the criticisms applied to examination of conscience. It is not a man who judges himself but it is God who, in His love, enlightens the hearts of those who love Him and enables them to see their faults and their omissions.
<p>Comprehension of the thought of al-Muḥāsibī is difficult if taken as a whole. J. van Ess has studied the intellectual climate in which al-Muḥāsibī lived, revealing in particular his relations with <em>kalām</em>. Here there is an important point of view which should serve as a starting-point in any effort to evaluate what is represented by the mystical doctrine of al-Muḥāsibī.
<p>He wielded an immense influence, which Massignon has analysed in detail in his <em>Essai</em> (254). Despite persistent attacks, his “powerful personality” ensured the survival of his prestige. Al-Sarī al-Saqatī, the maternal uncle of Junayd, was his pupil, and, through him, his teaching affected the nephew. The great mystic al-Ghazālī willingly acknowledged the authority of al-Muḥāsibī.",1

Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Consulted online on 24 July 2022","<p>Abu’l- Qāsim b. Muḥammad b. al-Junayd al-Khazzāz al-Qawārīrī al-Nihāwandī, the celebrated Ṣūfī, nephew and disciple of Sari al-Ṣaqaṭī, a native of Baghdād, studied law under Abu Thawr, and associated with Hārith al-Muḥāsibī, with whom indeed he is said to have discussed during walks all kinds of questions relating to mysticism, Muḥāsibī giving his replies extempore and later writing them up in the form of books (Abū Nuʿaym, <em>Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ</em>, Leyden MS, fol. 284a). He died in 298/910. With Muḥāsibī he is to be accounted the greatest orthodox exponent of the “Sober” type of Ṣūfism, and the titles which later writers bestowed on him—<em>sayyid al-ṭāʾifa</em> (“Lord of the Sect”), <em>ṭāʾus al-fuqarāʾ</em> (“Peacock of the Dervishes”), <em>shaykh al-mashāyikh</em> (“Director of the Directors”)—indicate in what esteem he was held. The <em>Fihrist</em> (186) mentions his <em>Rasāʾil</em>, which have in large measure survived, in a unique but fragmentary MS (see Brockelmann, S I, 354-5). These consist of letters to private persons (examples are quoted by Sarrāj, <em>Kitāb al-lumaʿ</em>, 239-43), and short tractates on mystical themes: some of the latter are cast in the form of commentaries on  Qurʾānic passages. His style is involved to the point of obscurity, and his influence on Ḥallāj is manifest. He mentions in one of his letters that a former communication of his had been opened and read in the course of transit: doubtless by some zealot desirous of finding cause for impugning his orthodoxy; and to this ever-present danger must in part be attributed the deliberate preciosity which marks the writings of all the mystics of Junayd’s period. Junayd reiterates the theme, first clearly reasoned by him, that since all things have their origin in God they must finally return, after their dispersion (<em>tafrīq</em>), to live again in Him (<em>jamʿ</em>): and this the mystic achieves in the state of passing-away (<em>fanāʾ</em>). Of the mystic union he writes “For at that time thou wilt be addressed, thyself addressing; questioned concerning thy tidings, thyself questioning; with abundant flow of benefits, and interchange of attestations; with constant increase of faith, and uninterrupted favours” (<em>Rasāʾil</em>, fol. 3a-b). Of his own mystical experience he says “This that I say comes from the continuance of calamity and the consequence of misery, from a heart that is stirred from its foundations, and is tormented with its ceaseless conflagrations, by itself within itself: admitting no perception, no speech, no sense, no feeling, no repose, no effort, no familiar image; but constant in the calamity of its ceaseless torment, unimaginable, indescribable, unlimited, unbearable in its fierce onslaughts” (fol. ia). Eschewing those extravagances of language which on the lips of such inebriates as Abū Yazīd al-Bisṭāmī and Ḥallāj alarmed and alienated the orthodox, Junayd by his clear perception and absolute self-control laid the foundations on which the later systems of Ṣūfism were built.",1
3,Abū Saʿīd al-Kharrāz,أبو سعيد الخراز,al-Kharrāz,الخراز,286,"Madelung, W., “al-Ḵh̲arrāz”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Consulted online on 24 July 2022","<p>Abū Saʿīd Aḥmad b. ʿĪsā , mystic of the school of Baghdād. Born in Baghdād probably early in the 3rd/9th century, he joined al-Nibājī, Abū ʿUbayd al-Busrī, Sarī al-Saqaṭī, Bishr al-Ḥāfī, Dhu’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī, Muḥammad b. Manṣūr al-Ṭūsī and other Ṣūfī shaykhs. He travelled extensively from an early age, though only few details about his itineraries are known from his own statements. His final departure from Baghdād may be connected with the wave of persecution of the Ṣūfīs instigated by the Ḥanbalī Ghulām al-Khalīl during the coregency of al-Muwaffaq (257-78/871-91), for he is reported to have been accused of infidelity by a group of ʿulamāʾ for some daring expressions in his Kitāb al-sirr. According to his own testimony, he visited al-Ramla, Jerusalem, and Ṣayda and lived in Mecca for eleven years, regularly visiting Medina in order to perform the pilgrimage from there. He was expelled from Mecca by the governor because of his teaching. During the last part of his life, and perhaps during an earlier period, he lived in Egypt. From there he travelled to al-Baṣra in order to meet the Ṣūfī Abū Ḥātim al-ʿAṭṭār, and he also visited Qayrawān. According to the best attested report, he died in 286/899.

<p>Like his contemporary al-Junayd, al-Kharrāz strove to combine a doctrine of ecstatic mysticism with orthodox support of the religious law. He affirmed that any esoteric (<em>bāṭin</em>) doctrine that contradicts the apparent meaning (<em>ẓāhir</em>) of the law is false. Upholding the superiority of the prophets over the saints (<em>awliyāʾ</em>), he argued that every prophet is a saint before becoming a prophet. He addressed a letter to a group of Ṣūfīs in Damascus, refuting their heretical view that they could see God with their hearts as the inhabitants of Paradise will see Him with their eyes. In a book on proper conduct in the canonical prayer (<em>adab al-ṣalāt</em>), he described the significance of its rites for the Ṣūfī. Al-kharrāz is credited by al-Sulamī and others with having been the first one to speak about the states of annihilation (<em>fanāʾ</em>) and subsistence (<em>baqāʾ</em>). This is not literally correct, for these concepts had been used by earlier Ṣūfīs and were commonplace among his contemporaries. They appear, however, as fundamental in his doctrine and designate the highest stages of the mystic “beyond which no created being can reach”. He defined <em>fanāʾ</em> as “annihilation of the consciousness of manhood” and baqāʾ as “subsistence in the contemplation of Godhead”. At the highest stage, so he stated in his Kitāb al-ḍiyāʾ, the mystic loses his (human) attributes and attains the attributes of God, a doctrine disputed by al-Junayd and expressly condemned as heretical by al-Sarrāj.",1
4,Abū al-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī,أبو الحسين النوري,al-Nūrī,النوري,295,"Schimmel, Annemarie, “al-Nūrī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Consulted online on 24 July 2022","<p>Abu ’l-Ḥusayn (or Abu ’l-Ḥasan) Aḥmad b. Muḥammad al-Baghawī, Ṣūfī mystic, of Khurāsānī background, was born (probably ca. 226/840, as he had met Dhu ’l-Nūn) in Baghdād, where he spent most of his life. He died in 295/907. The most extensive information about him is given by al-Sarrāj and al-Kalābādhī; the brief biographies of al-Sulamī and Abū Nuʿaym agree almost verbatim, as do the Persian notes in Anṣārī and Jāmī. ʿAṭṭār’s biography elaborates on otherwise little-known details; Baqlī devotes five chapters (§§ 95-9) of his <em>sharḥ-i shaṭḥiyyāt</em> to al-Nūrī.
<p>It is said that he acquired his surname because “he radiated light when talking”; he claimed “I looked into the light until I became that light myself.” A disciple of al-Ṣarī as-Saqaṭī, he underwent extreme self-mortification: “Ṣūfism is leaving all pleasures of the nafs ”, and emphasised the true faqīr’s reliance upon God alone. His best-known quality is <em>īthār</em>, i.e. that “it is a religious duty to prefer one’s companions to oneself; for “Ṣūfism consists not of forms and sciences but of <em>akhlāq</em>, good qualities.” That is illustrated by his attitude during the trial of the Ṣūfīs by Ghulām Khalīl in 264/877, where he offered up his life for his friends, whereupon the caliph acquitted the Ṣūfīs. Al-Nūrī was quite emotional, and considered intellect to be “incapable”; contrary to the sober and prudent junayd he enjoyed participating in the <em>samāʿ</em>: “The Ṣūfī is one who hears the <em>samāʿ</em>”, and Baqlī asks in his threnody (<em>Sharḥ</em>, § 377) “Where is the singing, tarannum, of Nūrī?” That his death was caused by his running, in full ecstasy, into a freshly-cut reedbed and dying from wounds, fits into this picture, as does Anṣārī’s remark that “he was more worshipping, aʿbad, than junayd.” Al-Nūrī, who, according to ʿAṭṭār, was seen weeping along with the sad Iblīs, claimed to be a lover, <em>ʿāshiq</em>, which led the Ḥanbalīs to declare him a heretic; but for him, <em>maḥabba</em> (mentioned in Qurʾān, V, 59) was a higher stage than <em>ʿishq</em>, and “Love is to tear the veils and unveil the secrets.” More dangerous seemed his remark “Deadly poison!”, when hearing the <em>muʾadhdhin’s</em> call, but answering a dog’s barking with <em>labbayka</em>; he intended to blame the one who performed religious duties for money, but understood every creature’s praise of God, even from the dog’s mouth.
<p>Al-Kalābādhī mentions that al-Nūrī wrote about mystical sciences with <em>ishārāt</em>, symbolic expressions, but only recently did P. Nwyia discover his <em>Maqāmāt al-qulūb</em>, which contains descriptions of the heart, that house of God, which is inhabited by the King Certitude, who is aided by two viziers, Fear and Hope. Such an allegorical interpretation of Qurʾānic data appears also in the comparison of the heart to a castle with seven ramparts (reminiscent of St. Theresa’s imagery). The language of al-Nūrī, called by ʿAṭṭār <em>laṭīf ẓarīf</em>, “fine and elegant”, is highly poetical, and a number of brief poems is attributed to him; the imagery of the heart as a garden which is fertilised, or else destroyed, by rain and in which laud and gratitude are the odoriferous herbs, prefigures Persian garden imagery. Al-Nūrī is called “the faithful one, <em>ṣāḥib al-wafāʾ</em>, and “prince of hearts”, <em>amīr al-qulūb</em>, and, as a true love mystic, was one of the most remarkable companions of Junayd. who said at his death, “half of Ṣūfism is gone”.",1
5,Abū Manṣūr Maʿmar b. Aḥmad al-Iṣfahānī,أبو منصور معمر بن أحمد الإصفهاني,Abū Manṣūr al-Iṣfahānī,أبو منصور الاصفهاني,418,"Pourjavady, Nasrollah, “Abū Manṣūr al-Iṣfahānī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE,Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. Consulted online on 25 July 2022","<p><span><b>Abū Manṣūr</b></span> Maʿmar b. Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Ziyād <span><b>al-Iṣfahānī</b></span> (d. 418/1027) was a traditionist, a self-proclaimed Ḥanbalī Ṣūfī <span><i>shaykh</i></span>, and author of several treatises on Ṣūfī doctrine and a Ṣūfī manual. Born between 335/946 and 339/950, in Isfahan, Abū Manṣūr studied there with renowned traditionists of his time, such as Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm b. Muḥammad b. Ḥamza al-Iṣfahānī (d. 353/964), Abū l-Qāsim al-Ṭabarānī (d. 360/971), and ʿAbdallāh b. Muḥammad b. Jaʿfar b. Ḥayyān (d. 369/979), known as Abū l-Shaykh. He was also connected to the Ṣūfī tradition of Isfahan, which he traced back to the famous Ṣūfī Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Sahl al-Iṣfahānī (d. 307/919), whom al-Ḥallāj (d. 309/922) had visited while in that city, and to Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad b. Yūsuf al-Bannāʾ (d. 286/899), the first ascetic in Isfahan to have been called a Ṣūfī. Ṣūfism in Isfahan was closely connected to the Ḥanbalī school of law and theology and was influenced by the mystical teachings of <span><i>shaykh</i></span>s from Baghdad, particularly Abū Saʿīd al-Kharrāz (d. 286/899) and Abū l-Qāsim al-Junayd (d. 297/910). On his way to Mecca, Abū Manṣūr himself may well have stopped in Baghdad and visited followers of the great <span><i>shaykh</i></span>s, such as al-Junayd, Abū l-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī (d. 295/907), al-Kharrāz, and Abū Bakr al-Shiblī (d. 334/945).</p>
<p>Abū Manṣūr lived in Isfahan at exactly the same time as the famous Ṣūfī hagiographer Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī, so they must have known each other and perhaps even were fellow students at some point. However, neither one of them mentions the other in his works. This may well have been due to the notorious conflict between Abū Nuʿaym and the famous Ḥanbalī scholar of Isfahan Abū ʿAbdallāh b. Manda (d. 395/1004), as a result of which Abū Nuʿaym, who was accused of adopting some of the theological beliefs of the Ashʿarīs, was threatened and banished from the great mosque of the city. Abū Manṣūr was a close associate of Ibn Manda—he even married the latter’s widow and had two daughters by her—and it would have been natural for him to take his side.</p>
<p>As well as being a traditionist and a transmitter of <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>, Abū Manṣūr was an original Ṣūfī thinker, whose teachings have largely been preserved in his writings. He wrote several treatises on Ṣūfī doctrine and a Ṣūfī manual, almost all of which have been preserved in a codex that was found in 1962 in Shiraz (Khāniqāh-i Aḥmadī, MS 87; Meier, 60–2). One of the most important treatises in this codex, entitled <span><i>Nahj al-khāṣṣ</i></span>, concerns the stations of the spiritual path. Forty stations are defined, each of which is divided into three stages. This treatise, with its tripartite division, had an impact on later Ṣūfī works dealing with technical terms and the definitions of stations. ʿAbdallāh al-Anṣārī of Herat (d. 481/1089) used it as a model for writing his <span><i>Manāzil al-sāʾirīn</i></span> (de Beaurecueil, Introduction to <span><i>Nahj</i></span>, 67–71) and his Persian treatise <span><i>Ṣad maydān</i></span> (Pourjavady, <span><i>Sayr</i></span>, 16). Moreover, sixteen terms with their definitions mentioned in the <span><i>Nahj</i></span> were borrowed by the anonymous author of the <span><i>Kitāb al-ʿibārāt</i></span> (wrongly attributed to al-Qushayrī). From there, they made their way first into Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī’s (d. 505/1111) <span><i>Iḥyāʾ</i></span> and then into Ibn ʿArabī’s (d. 638/1240) <span><i>al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya,</i></span> as well as his <span><i>Iṣṭilāḥāt</i></span>, a treatise on Ṣūfī terms (for a detailed study of this transmission, see Pourjavady, <span><i>Sayr).</i></span>
</p>
<p>Another treatise by Abū Manṣūr, similar in style and form to the <span><i>Nahj</i></span>, is <span><i>Ādāb al-mutaṣawwifa wa-ḥaqāʾiquhā wa-ishārātuhā</i></span>, in which, as the title indicates, rules of spiritual conduct (thirty-one, in this treatise) are explained. In this original work on special proprieties in Ṣūfism, which differs from the works of Khurāsānī Ṣūfī writers such as Abū Naṣr al-Sarrāj (d. 378/988) and al-Sulamī (d. 412/1021), Abū Manṣūr first divides each <span><i>adab</i></span>, or rule of conduct, into three levels; he then goes on to explain the three aspects of its essential nature <span><i>(ḥaqāʾiq)</i></span> as well as the three aspects of its allusions <span><i>(ishārāt)</i></span>.</p>
<p>Abū Manṣūr’s treatise on <span><i>dhikr</i></span> (recollection of God), entitled <span><i>Kitāb sharḥ al-adhkār</i></span>, is the oldest independent work on this topic. Unlike the chapters on <span><i>dhikr</i></span> in Khurāsānī Ṣūfī manuals, such as al-Sarrāj’s <span><i>K. al-Lumaʿ</i></span> or <span><i>al-Taʿarruf</i></span> by al-Kalābādhī (d. 380/990 or 384/994), Abū Manṣūr’s treatise is not primarily a collection of sayings by Ṣūfī masters on the practice of <span><i>dhikr.</i></span> He views this practice from both an exoteric and an esoteric point of view. Recollecting God is done by the tongue, the heart, and the inner, or secret, part <span><i>(sirr)</i></span>. Thus, one is engaged in the practice of recollection not only while in the mystical states of gratitude <span><i>(shukr)</i></span> or patience <span><i>(ṣabr)</i></span>, but also while carrying out the five pillars of Faith, that is, the ritual daily prayers <span><i>(ṣalāt)</i></span>, fasting <span><i>(ṣawm)</i></span>, pilgrimage <span><i>(ḥajj)</i></span>, giving alms <span><i>(zakāt)</i></span>, and holy war <span><i>( jihād)</i></span>.</p>
<p>A treatise containing forty prophetic <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>s related to Ṣūfism, <span><i>K. al-aḥādīth al-arbaʿīn</i></span>, is another work that deals with Ṣūfī doctrine. In the printed edition, based on the Shiraz codex, the treatise is divided into thirty-eight chapters, in which the author discusses theological beliefs, practical or moral issues, and the states or stations of the path. Abū Manṣūr’s Ḥanbalī beliefs <span><i>(ʿaqīda)</i></span> are outlined in two treatises, the <span><i>K. al-Manāhij bi-shāhid al-sunna wa-nahj al-mutaṣawwifa</i></span> and the <span><i>K. al-Minhāj wa-l-masāʾil wa-l-waṣiyya</i></span>. The latter work, as its title suggests, consists in fact of three short pieces, most likely put together by the compiler of the codex. Another treatise, entitled <span><i>Dhikr maʿānī l-taṣawwuf wa-ādābihi wa-ḥaqāʾiqihi wa-rusūmihi</i></span> (“Definitions of Ṣūfism and its codes of conduct, realities, and customs”), is a short work in two parts. The first part consists of twenty-nine definitions of Ṣūfism <span><i>(taṣawwuf)</i></span>, beginning with nouns whose first letters follow the order of the Arabic alphabet. The second part is a <span><i>qaṣīda</i></span>, again in twenty-nine lines, arranged alphabetically according to the initial letters of the lines. Abū Manṣūr also composed other poems. In his <span><i>Taʾrīkh al-Islām</i></span> (3:454–5), al-Dhahabī (d. 749/1348) quotes a <span><i>qaṣīda</i></span> of nine lines that Abū Manṣūr composed upon the death of Ibn Manda. Abū Manṣūr’s interest in poetry is further reflected in a commentary he wrote on five famous verses by the Ṣūfī martyr al-Ḥallāj, of which the first is <span><i>a-anta am ana hādhā l-haynu fī l-haynī</i></span>. In the only surviving manuscript of this work, the poem is attributed not to al-Ḥallāj, however, but to a fictitious <span><i>shaykh</i></span> named Abū ʿAbdallāh al-Murshidī.</p>
<p>Finally, the Shiraz codex contains a manual on Ṣūfism entitled <span><i>Adab al-mulūk.</i></span> Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, the name of the author of this work is not mentioned, and its attribution has been a matter of controversy. Fritz Meier thought it might be by Abū Manṣūr but also considered other possibilities. Pourjavady, while editing the chapter on <span><i>samāʿ</i></span>, found that the language and the style of the work were very similar to those of Abū Manṣūr. Moreover, the work is different from other Ṣūfī manuals written by Khurāsānī authors, such as al-Sarrāj, al-Kalābādhī, Abū Saʿd Khargūshī (al-Kharkūshī) (d. 406–7/1015–6), and Abū l-Qāsim al-Qushayrī (d. 465/1072). Based on these findings, Pourjavady decided to publish it under the name of Abū Manṣūr (see Abū Manṣūr, <span><i>Du risāla</i></span>, 32). Bernd Radtke, the editor of the entire <span><i>Adab al-mulūk</i></span>, however, still considers the author of this work anonymous.</p>
<p>Like Abū Nuʿaym, Abū Manṣūr wrote a work of Ṣūfī history and biography with particular attention to the Isfahanis. So far, this book has not been found, although the accounts of the Isfahani <span><i>shaykh</i></span>s are quoted from it by Abū l-Qāsim al-Taymī al-Iṣfahānī (d. 535/1140–1) in his <span><i>Siyar al-salaf</i></span> (Pourjavady, <span><i>Guzārishhā),</i></span> and twelve historical reports on the Ṣūfīs of Baghdad are cited by al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī (d. 463/1071) in his <span><i>Taʾrīkh Baghdād</i></span> (Pourjavady, <span><i>Abū Manṣūr al-Iṣfahānī</i></span>, 72–80).</p>

7,Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nuʿmān b. Thābit,أبو حنيفة النعمان بن ثابت,Abū Ḥanīfa,أبو حنيفة,150,"Yanagihashi, Hiroyuki, “Abū Ḥanīfa”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.","<p>Abū Ḥanīfa was born in Kufa circa 80/699 and died in Baghdad in 150/767, reportedly at the age of seventy. His grandfather Zūṭā, who lived in Kābul, had been taken captive and become a slave of the Arab tribe Taymallāh b. Thaʿlaba. Zūṭā was later brought to Kufa, where he was manumitted, whereupon he and his descendants became <span><i>mawlā</i></span>s of that tribe. This account was contested, however, by Abū Ḥanīfa’s grandson Ismāʿīl (d. 212/827–8), who called himself Ismāʿīl b. Ḥammād b. al-Nuʿmān b. Thābit b. al-Nuʿmān b. al-Marzubān, apparently in an attempt to elevate his grandfather's status, claiming that “We are of free Persian origin, having never been enslaved” (al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, 13:326). “Marzubān” is the Arabised form of “Marzpān”, a Persian term for a local leader. Abū Ḥanīfa’s father Thābit was born a Muslim. Like his father, Abū Ḥanīfa was reportedly a successful merchant who sold <span><i>khazz</i></span>, a silk fabric. We are told that his interest in theology and law was triggered by al-Shaʿbī (d. c.104/722–3), a Kufan traditionist and jurist. In addition to al-Shaʿbī, the list of the traditionists and jurists with whom he studied includes Nāfiʿ (d. c.117/735–6), a <span><i>mawlā</i></span> of Ibn ʿUmar who transmitted many traditions from him; ʿAṭāʾ b. Abī Rabāḥ (d. c.114/732–3), a leading Meccan jurist; and Rabīʿa b. Abī ʿAbd al-Raḥmān (d. c.136/753–4), a Medinese authority. For eighteen to twenty years Abū Ḥanīfa attended the circle of the Kufan jurist Ḥammād b. Abī Sulaymān, who eventually allowed no one but him to sit directly in front of him in his circle <span><i>(ḥalqa)</i></span>, thus treating him as an accomplished jurist. After studying with Ḥammād for ten years, Abū Ḥanīfa contemplated forming his own circle. Around this time, however, Ḥammād learned of the death of a relative in Basra. Before leaving for Basra, he instructed Abū Ḥanīfa to take his place as leader of the circle. When Ḥammād returned two months later, Abū Ḥanīfa gave him approximately sixty questions to which he had responded during his master’s absence. Ḥammād agreed with Abū Ḥanīfa’s responses to forty of these questions but disagreed with him about the remaining twenty. Abū Ḥanīfa therefore decided not to form a circle of his own (al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, 13:333). After Ḥammād’s death (120/737), however, Abū Ḥanīfa became the leader of his master’s circle.</p>
<p>In jurisprudence, Abū Ḥanīfa’s disciples included Zufar b. al-Hudhayl b. Qays al-ʿAnbarī (d. 158/775), Abū Yūsuf (d. 182/798), and al-Shaybānī (d. 189/805). Abū Ḥanīfa, Abū Yūsuf, and al-Shaybānī subsequently came to be regarded as the founders of the Ḥanafī law school. In theology, his disciples included Abū Muṭīʿ al-Balkhī (d. 199/814) and Abū Muqātil Ḥafṣ b. Salm al-Samarqandī (d. 208/823–4), who introduced their master’s teachings to their homeland of Khurāsān, where Ḥanafism became predominant. Towards the end of the Umayyad period, Abū Ḥanīfa was flogged after refusing to take up the post of <span><i>qāḍī</i></span> of Kufa in response to an offer from Yūsuf b. ʿUmar b. Hubayra, then governor of Iraq (129–32/746–9). In 130/747–8, Abū Ḥanīfa fled to Mecca, where he lived for several years. It was not until the reign of the second ʿAbbāsid caliph, al-Manṣūr (r. 136–58/754–75), that he returned to Kufa. When al-Manṣūr summoned Abū Ḥanīfa to Baghdad to appoint him as a <span><i>qāḍī</i></span>, he again refused the office and was imprisoned, either because of his refusal or, as Schacht and van Ess have surmised, because of remarks that he made at the time of the ʿAlid revolt in 145/762 headed by al-Nafs al-Zakiyya and his brother Ibrāhīm (Schacht, Abū Ḥanīfa; van Ess, 187). It is not clear whether Abū Ḥanīfa died in prison or after his release. His only son, Ḥammād (d. 176/792–3), reportedly studied law with his father. Of Ḥammād’s four sons, Ismāʿīl b. Ḥammād became the <span><i>qāḍī</i></span> of Basra, the eastern bank of Baghdad, Kufa, and al-Raqqa, where he died.",1
8,ʿAbd Allāh b. Yazīd al-Fazārī,عبد الله بن يزيد الفزاري,al-Fazārī,الفزاري,179,"Madelung, Wilferd, “al-Fazārī, ʿAbdallāh b. Yazīd”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.","<p>Abū Muḥammad <span><b>ʿAbdallāh b. Yazīd al-Fazārī</b></span> (b. c. 130/748, d. after 179/795) was a Kufan Ibāḍī <span><i>kalām</i></span> theologian of the Ibāḍī subsect of the Khārijīs. He was born in Kufa, probably not later than 130/748, into a family of the Arab tribe of Fazāra. His training as an Ibāḍī scholar most likely took place in Basra under Abū ʿUbayda Muslim b. Abī Karīma (d. before 158/775), whom he recognised as the spiritual leader of the early Ibāḍiyya, after Jābir b. Zayd al-Azdī (d. c. 93/712). In Kufa al-Fazārī owned a silk trading shop jointly with the Shīʿī theologian Hishām b. al-Ḥakam (d. 179/795–6), and it was there that he taught. His teaching at that time attracted Berber Ibāḍī students from the Maghrib, who carried his doctrines back to their North African homeland. In 168/785 the Ibāḍī community in the Maghrib split over the succession to the Maghribī imāmate of the second Rustamid ruler, ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān (r. 168–208/785–824). The majority accepted his imāmate, which was also backed by al-Rabīʿ b. Ḥabīb (d. c. 170/787), the spiritual head of the Ibāḍiyya in Basra, after Abū ʿUbayda. A substantial minority, however, rejected the imāmate of ʿAbd al-Wahhāb and they became known as the Nukkār (“rejecters”). They continued to recognise al-Fazārī as their authoritative teacher of theology and later preserved his doctrinal works.</p>
<p>For business reasons, al-Fazārī and his partner, Hishām b. al-Ḥakam, moved to Baghdad, most likely around 170/787, where, however, they set up separate shops. Both were drawn into the debating circle sponsored by the Barmakid courtier Yaḥyā b. Khālid (d. 190/805). In 179/795 the caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (170–93/786–809) prohibited these debates and ordered the arrest of some of the participants. Al-Fazārī escaped and fled to northern Yemen, where he found refuge with the local Khārijīs and became known there by the <span><i>nisba</i></span> al-Baghdādī. The majority of the Khārijīs in Yemen at the time were adherents of the Ṣufriyya subsect, but al-Fazārī succeeded in converting them by his teaching to the Ibāḍiyya.</p>
<p>The date of al-Fazārī’s death in Yemen is unknown. His extensive teaching activity there suggests, however, that he may have lived in Yemen for a decade or two.</p>
<p>Al-Fazārī’s theological thought was basically conditioned by the traditionalist position taken by his Basran teacher Abū ʿUbayda, in opposition to Muʿtazilī rationalism. Al-Fazārī insisted that the religious truths of Islam were known exclusively by revelation and could not be acquired by reason. In contrast to most other disciples of Abū ʿUbayda, however, he defended traditionalist positions with the dialectic argumentation of contemporary <span><i>kalām</i></span> theology and quickly became the most famous Ibāḍī <span><i>kalām</i></span> theologian of his age. His <span><i>kalām</i></span> teaching attracted in particular students from the Berber Ibāḍī community in the Maghrib, who were engaged in disputations with the large Berber Muʿtazilī community in the western Maghrib, locally known as the Wāṣiliyya. A substantial part of his early works has been preserved among the contemporary Ibāḍī Nukkār community in the Maghrib.</p>
<p>In his extant <span><i>Kitāb al-qadar</i></span>, al-Fazārī upholds divine determinism against the Muʿtazilī doctrine of human free will. He argues that God, as the Creator of the world, may arbitrarily favour some of his creatures over others by conferring upon them the gift of faith. He affirms, however, that God will not punish infidels for their lack of faith—the result of His not granting it to them—but only for the evil acts committed by them voluntarily. The final section of the book is a later addition by him, in which he answers questions of his Maghribī followers, who were engaged in disputations with Muʿtazilīs. He emphatically states that God creates unbelief and faith only in the sense of His determining them <span><i>(taqdīr)</i></span>, and he distances himself from radical determinists who assert that God creates the human acts of unbelief and faith just as He created heaven and earth. The latter position was later upheld in <span><i>kalām</i></span> by the Sunnī al-Ashʿarī (d. 324/936).</p>
<p>Al-Fazārī’s fragmentarily preserved <span><i>Kitāb al-radd ʿalā l-mujassima</i></span> (“The book of refutation of the corporealists”) consists of two sections. In the first section he refutes the views of the Shīʿī theologian and his former business partner Hishām b. al-Ḥakam, including his doctrine of <span><i>badāʾ</i></span>, God’s ability to change His decisions. The second section is devoted for the most part to a refutation of traditionalist anthropomorphist doctrine. He affirms that God creates His speech, which is originated in time. This section evidently is addressed to the Sunnī traditionalists known by the derogatory nickname Ḥashwiyya (scholars of no consequence), whose views were later upheld by Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 241/855).</p>
<p>In his extant <span><i>Kitāb fīhi l-radd ʿalā Ibn ʿUmayr</i></span>, al-Fazārī refutes the theology of his Kufan rival ʿĪsā b. ʿUmayr al-Hamdānī, who had gained a substantial following among the Ibāḍiyya in the region to the east of Jabal Nafūsa in Libya and were later known as the ʿUmayriyya. Ibn ʿUmayr, like al-Fazārī, claimed in his letters to the Maghribī Ibāḍīs to represent the teaching of Abū ʿUbayda, but al-Fazārī denounces him as rather backing rationalist doctrines of the Muʿtazila and the radical Shīʿa. In his refutation he rejects in particular Ibn ʿUmayr’s thesis that God is obliged to verify His messengers’ claims to prophethood through miracles or the testimony of a recognised prophet. He also sharply criticises Ibn ʿUmayr’s view that the Muslim community does not need an <span><i>imām</i></span> if Muslims faithfully obey God’s commandments. Al-Fazārī affirms that an <span><i>imām</i></span> is required in Islam to carry out specific duties under religious law and extols the exemplary conduct of Abū Bakr and ʿUmar as Muslim <span><i>imām</i></span>s.</p>
<p>In the <span><i>Kitāb al-futyā</i></span> (“Book of legal opinion”), which consists of questions and answers, al-Fazārī asserts that the territory of Islam after the first inter-Muslim war, during the caliphate of ʿUthmān (r. 23–35/644–55), became an abode of both faith and hypocrisy <span><i>(dār īmān wa-nifāq)</i></span>. This means that the simple confession of faith <span><i>(shahāda)</i></span> required of Muslims in the age of the Prophet Muḥammad and the first two caliphs is no longer sufficient evidence of true Muslim faith, and further proof of sound belief is now required. Muslims meeting strangers who claim to be Muslims merely on the basis of reciting the <span><i>shahāda</i></span> must suspend judgement <span><i>(wuqūf)</i></span> with regard to their status until further evidence of their sound belief is provided. Al-Fazārī explains that his view here is at variance with that of most of the Ibāḍiyya of his time, who do not allow <span><i>wuqūf</i></span> in judging a professed Muslim’s faith. From al-Fazārī’s discussion it is evident that he wanted in particular to exclude from Islam the Qadariyya, who were upholders of the tenet of human free will, and extremist Khārijites.</p>
<p>Al-Fazārī’s <span><i>Kitāb al-tawḥīd fī maʿrifat Allāh</i></span> (“Book of unity on the knowledge of God”) and <span><i>Kitāb fī man rajaʿa ʿan dīnih wa-fāraqa al-nabī wa-huwa ʿalā dīnih</i></span> (“Book on those who backslide from their religion and part with the Prophet after sharing his religion”) both consist of questions and answers and deal with a wide range of matters raised in contemporary <span><i>kalām</i></span> theology. Noteworthy in the <span><i>Kitāb al-tawḥīd</i></span> is the high level of sophistication of al-Fazārī’s discussion of divine names and attributes and the distinction he makes between attributes of essence and of act. His discussion indicates that the theory of divine attributes of essence and act in <span><i>kalām</i></span> theology must have already developed early in the second/eighth century, rather than in the latter part of that century, as has often been assumed. In the <span><i>Kitāb fī man rajaʿa ʿan dīnih</i></span>, al-Fazārī greatly expands on his position concerning <span><i>walāya</i></span> and <span><i>barāʾa</i></span>, association and dissociation, respectively, and the need for <span><i>wuqūf.</i></span>
</p>
<p>Maghribī Ibāḍī tradition further attributes a <span><i>Kitāb al-rudūd</i></span> to al-Fazārī, of which a fragmentary copy existed until recently. Al-Fazārī also appears as a transmitter of historical reports in a <span><i>Kitāb al-Nahrawān</i></span> (site of the battle where ʿAlī’s forces massacred the initial Khārijī defectors from his cause) by an anonymous Ibāḍī author, which apparently is quoted by the historian al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923) and the late Ibāḍī authors al-Barrādī (eighth/fourteenth c.) and al-Shammākhī (d. 928/1522).</p>
<p>Al-Fazārī’s later literary activity in Yemen is known only from Yemeni Zaydī Shīʿī sources. The Nukkār community in the Maghrib seems to have lost touch with him after his flight from Baghdad. His early works evidently were unknown in Yemen, and once in Yemen he composed books for the specific sectarian environment in his new home. Zaydī sources mention a refutation of the Ṣufriyya (<span><i>Masāʾil al-Ṣufriyya)</i></span> and a <span><i>Kitāb al-taḥkīm</i></span> (“Book of arbitration”), evidently about the arbitration agreement between ʿAlī and Muʿāwiya, which was condemned by the early Khārijī seceders as a violation of a Qurʾānic pronouncement that there is no judgement but God’s (Q 12:40 and 67). Extant is his <span><i>Kitāb al-radd ʿalā l-Qadariyya</i></span>, the text of which is quoted in its entirety in its refutation titled <span><i>Kitāb al-najāt li-man ittabaʿa l-hudā wa-jtanaba l-radā</i></span> of that text by the Zaydī <span><i>imām</i></span> Aḥmad al-Nāṣir li-Dīn Allāh (d. 322/934). In contrast to al-Fazārī’s early <span><i>Kitāb al-qadar</i></span>, which presents a systematic treatment of divine determinism, the latter work is a collection of polemical arguments addressed to the upholders of human free will. In substance his theological views do not seem to have changed in his later life.</p>",0
9,Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb b. Isḥāq al-Kindī,أبو يوسف يعقوب بن إسحاق الكندي,al-Kindī,الكندي,260,"Adamson, Peter, “al-Kindī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson","<p>Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb b. Isḥāq <span><b>al-Kindī</b></span> (d. c.256/870) is recognised as the first Hellenising philosopher to write in Arabic. He was known as the “philosopher of the Arabs,” a particularly apt honorific. He came from the important Arab tribe of Kinda and could trace his lineage back to a companion of the Prophet. He was arguably the first “philosopher” of the Islamic world, at least if “philosopher” means someone who draws on the sciences of the Greeks. Despite occasional reports that he translated from Greek, it seems that his involvement in the prodigious translation movement sponsored under the ʿAbbāsids consisted in guiding the work of Christian translators. These were men like Ibn Nāʿima al-Ḥimṣī—who rendered the works of the late ancient Platonist thinker Plotinus (d. 270 or 271 C.E.) into Arabic, in a version that was in due course mistaken for a work by Aristotle (d. 322 B.C.E.; the so-called <span><i>Theology of Aristotle</i></span>)—and Usṭāth, who translated the genuinely Aristotelian <span><i>Metaphysics</i></span>. Versions of numerous other Greek texts are traceable to the so-called “Kindī circle,” including those of philosophers like the Neoplatonist Proclus (d. 485 C.E.) and the Aristotelian commentator Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. c.200 C.E.), and mathematicians like Euclid (d. c.285 B.C.E.) and Nicomachus of Gerasa (fl. c.100 C.E.). In addition to selecting the source texts al-Kindī is known to have “corrected” draft translations; whether he made more dramatic interventions to produce texts like the paraphrastic <span><i>Theology of Aristotle</i></span> is a matter of dispute. As an aristocrat with links to the caliphal court (he was tutor to the son of al-Muʿtaṣim, r. 218–27/833–42), al-Kindī was well placed to advertise the potential benefits of Greek thought. In his own writings he displayed their relevance on topics ranging from the abstract (e.g., the nature of soul) to the quotidian (e.g., removing stains from clothes).</p>
<p>Al-Kindī’s endeavours were not without precedent. Translations into Arabic had already begun in the previous century, and there was a tradition of translation and philosophical reflection in Syriac. Al-Kindī’s extensive interest in logic, a preoccupation in the Christian Syriac literature, is one sign of his indebtedness to these precursors. He himself alludes to the logical expertise of the Christians in a brief refutation of the Trinity, saying that he draws on Porphyry’s (d. c.305 C.E.) <span><i>Eisagoge</i></span> (“Introduction”) to Aristotle’s logical works because it is well known to his opponents. A list of his works in the <span><i>Fihrist</i></span> (“List”), an invaluable catalogue of authors and works known to the bibliophile Ibn al-Nadīm (d. 380/990), includes numerous titles on logic, which are unfortunately largely lost—a fate that has befallen most of the hundreds of known titles by al-Kindī. Thanks especially to the codex Ayasofya 4832, a multitext manuscript held in the Süleymaniye Library, Istanbul, and published in facsimilie (ed. Sezgin, Hogendijk, and Käs), several dozen of his works in philosophy, as well as treatises on such sciences as astrology, music, mathematics, and pharmacology are still extant. If logic provided one important method for al-Kindī in pursuing all these topics, another was offered by mathematics. He often uses arguments patterned on those he could find in Euclid, for instance when proving the impossibility of an infinitely large body as a step towards refuting the notion that the universe is eternal.</p>
<p>The refutation of the existence of an infinitely large body plays a central role in what remains of al-Kindī’s most accomplished philosophical treatise, <span><i>Fī l-falsafa al-ūlā</i></span> (“On first philosophy”). Like most of his works, this takes the form of an epistle dedicated to an honoured recipient, in this case no less a personage than the caliph al-Muʿtaṣim himself. The book is partially lost. Its four extant sections include a forthright defence of using Greek materials (where he famously remarks that “we must not be ashamed to admire the truth or to acquire it, from wherever it comes”), the argument against the eternity of the universe on the basis that a finite body cannot have any infinite properties, and a lengthy demonstration of God’s ineffability. In this latter section al-Kindī draws again on Aristotelian logic, moving through the types of predicate to argue that none of them can apply to a “true One,” that is, a unity that is completely free of multiplicity. Only at the end of the treatise is this “true One” explicitly identified as the God of Islam and, in apparent contradiction to the purely negative theology expounded in the previous pages, described after all with a series of Qurʾānic epithets.</p>
<p>Another important source for al-Kindī’s argumentation was the Neoplatonic material translated by his circle. Not only does his “true One” have a clear affinity to the first cause of all things postulated by Plotinus (“the One”), but, following Plotinus and departing from Aristotle, God is distinguished from intellect on the basis that an intellect must have multiplicity. This suggests that in another epistle devoted specifically to the topic of intellect, the permanently actual “first intellect” mentioned by al-Kindī is not divine, though it does seems to be a transcendent cosmological principle, a mind outside the human intellect. In a classification that draws on late antique commentaries of Aristotle’s <span><i>De anima</i></span> (“On the soul”) and that anticipates what is later found in al-Fārābī (d. 339/950–1) and other philosophers of the Islamic world, al-Kindī distinguishes several stages of actualisation in the human mind. The mind begins as potential and is then “actualised by the first intellect,” thereby explaining a person’s comprehension of intelligible things, that is, the universal objects that are the target of knowledge properly speaking. When comprehension occurs, the mind and its intelligible object become identical.</p>
<p>For the most part al-Kindī passes over the question of what, if any, role sensory experience might play in this process. In fact, another brief text even shows him following the Platonic idea that the mind’s objects are recollected, rather than being gleaned from sensation. An exception is the beginning of a work preserved only in Latin, <span><i>De radiis</i></span> (“On rays”), which sets out a sketchy empiricist epistemology before moving on to explain a wide range of phenomena such as vision and magic with recourse to the mechanism of “rays.” This interest in rays may connect to a series of other Kindian works on optics. In these treatises, based on the ideas of Euclid, Ptolemy (d. c.170 C.E.), and others, al-Kindī defends the notion that eyesight depends on visual rays propagated from the eye. Light is analysed using the same notion of a rectilinear ray. This optical theory has been recognised as an important precursor of the later breakthroughs made by Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, d. c.431/1040), who was the first to understand that sight is the result of light reaching the eye after being reflected from objects. Al-Kindī also explored other aspects of light and vision, for instance in treatises on mirrors and on the reason why the sky is blue. On this question al-Kindī explains that the blue colour is caused by sunlight meeting exhalations from the surface of the earth, a line of reasoning also used to account for a range of meteorological phenomena in other treatises.</p>
<p>Usually al-Kindī’s scientific works depend heavily on mathematical methods, as with the use of geometrical demonstrations in the aforementioned texts on optics, or, in another field, his arithmetical account of the effects of compound drugs. A further example is found in his musical works, given that music was considered one of the four mathematical sciences. Four extant treatises deal especially with stringed instruments and above all the <span><i>ʿūd</i></span> (oud, lute) and give al-Kindī the chance to describe the effects of music upon the listener thanks to a resonance between the instrument and the soul. An anecdote related by the Egyptian historian al-Qifṭī (d. 646/1248) confirms his reputation for expertise in this matter, since it has al-Kindī getting his students to play a lute in order to revive a youth who has been struck by apoplexy.</p>
<p>In epistles devoted especially to the soul, however, al-Kindī relies more on Platonist and even Pythagorean literature. A treatise called <span><i>al-Qawl fī l-nafs</i></span> (“Discourse on the soul”) quotes Plato (d. 347 B.C.E.), Pythagoras (d. c.490 B.C.E.), and Aristotle to present the soul as a simple immaterial substance, “divine and spiritual,” and thus capable of surviving bodily death, after which it may hope to come to the intelligible realm, “the world of truth, where the light of the Creator shines.” Another text proves the immateriality of the soul by equating it with the essence of the living thing, which means that the soul is a form or even a “species.” Here al-Kindī is in part drawing on the idea of a secondary substance from Aristotle’s <span><i>Categories</i></span>, a striking instance of his dependency on the tools provided by the opening treatises from Aristotle’s logical corpus. For Aristotle secondary substances are species and genera, for instance <span><i>human</i></span> or <span><i>animal</i></span>, whereas particulars like individual humans would be “primary substances.” It is strange that al-Kindī should identify the soul as a species—the soul would not seem to be the same as <span><i>humanity</i></span>—but the confusion is understandable because the Greek word <span><i>eidos</i></span> can mean both “species” and “form.”</p>
<p>For more detail on the soul’s relation to body, one can turn to al-Kindī’s <span><i>Fī māhiyyat al-nawm wa-l-ruʾyā</i></span> (“On the quiddity of sleep and dreams”), which is based fairly closely on Aristotle’s discussion of these topics in his <span><i>Parva naturalia</i></span> (a collection of shorter works on natural philosophy and especially psychology; an Arabic version linked to the Kindī circle is significantly different from the Greek). Here it is argued that the brain is the organ of some psychological powers, such as the imaginative faculty that produces dreams. Prophetic dreams are possible because the soul is the “place of forms” and thus receives knowledge about all things, both sensible and intelligible, images of which may be displayed in the imagination during sleep.</p>
<p>The contrast between the intelligible realm and the world of the senses is also crucial in al-Kindī’s ethics. In this area his most extensive treatment is an epistle on the avoidance of sorrow, <span><i>Fī l-ḥīla li-dafʿ al-aḥzān</i></span> (“On dispelling sorrows”). This epistle offers a wealth of practical advice and encouragement, enlivened by anecdotes about such ancient figures as Socrates and Alexander the Great. (Al-Kindī was evidently very interested in Socrates, as can be gathered from his collection of gnomological sayings ascribed to Socrates, two of which also appear in <span><i>Fī l-ḥīla</i></span>.) The work begins with a philosophical consideration intended to ward off sorrow in advance: a person should consider that all things that can be valued in this world are apt to be lost, whereas things in the “intellectual world” are immune to loss.</p>
<p>The approach of this work on sorrow is echoed in a treatise by Abū Zayd al-Balkhī (d. 322/934), one of three important immediate associates of al-Kindī. Abū Zayd wrote <span><i>Maṣāliḥ al-abdān wa-l-anfus</i></span> (“Hygiene of souls and bodies”), divided into sections on medicine for the body and regimen for the soul, the latter part providing advice similar to that given by al-Kindī. The treatment of music in this treatise is also reminiscent of what has been mentioned above about al-Kindī’s work in this area. Alongside Abū Zayd, al-Kindī’s most significant student was Aḥmad b. al-Ṭayyib al-Sarakhsī (d. 286/899), whose treatises were evidently based in part on those of al-Kindī; again, many are lost but it is known that they in some cases had identical titles. (This is also true for the Jewish philosopher Isaac Israeli, d. c.955 C.E., who evidently takes inspiration from al-Kindī though the exact route of influence remains unclear.) A particularly interesting testimony found in al-Sarakhsī is al-Kindī’s report on the pagan Ṣābians gathered in the ancient city of Ḥarrān, now in southeastern Turkey. A third associate was the great astrologer Abū Maʿshar (d. 272/886), who, according to Ibn al-Nadīm, was converted to the mathematical sciences by al-Kindī. The philosophical rationale underlying Abū Maʿshar’s work on astrology is similar to that used by al-Kindī in his own numerous treatises on astrology, which investigate such questions as the use of the stars in weather prediction, the wisdom of taking a journey at a given time, and the expected duration of the rule of the Arabs.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that a range of thinkers from the next several generations represent a “Kindian tradition.” These would include, in addition to his direct associates just mentioned, such figures as the philosophers al-ʿĀmirī (d. 381/992) and Miskawayh (d. 421/1030) and perhaps even the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ (Brethren of Purity), a mysterious group of fourth/tenth century authors who produced an encyclopaedic collection of <span><i>Rasāʾil</i></span> (“Epistles”) on all the philosophical sciences. These various thinkers draw extensively on the translations produced by the Kindī circle and in some case on works by al-Kindī himself: for instance, Miskawayh quotes from <span><i>Fī l-ḥīla</i></span> and also uses material from <span><i>Fī l-falsafa al-ūlā</i></span>. Yet al-Kindī’s greatest legacy was a broader one, and consisted above all in the wide diffusion and influence of translated Greek works throughout the Islamic world.</p>

10,Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Zakariyā' al-Rāzī,أبو بكر محمد بن زكرياء الرازي,al-Rāzī,الرازي,313,"Goodman, L.E., “al-Rāzī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.","<span class=""small-caps"">Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Zakariyyāʾ</span>, known to the Latins as Rhazes (<span><i>ca</i></span>. 250/854-313/925 or 323/935), physician, philosopher and alchemist.</p><p>The most free-thinking of the major philosophers of Islam, al-Rāzī was born in Rayy, where he was well trained in the Greek sciences. He was reputedly well versed in musical theory and performance before becoming a physician. His work in alchemy takes a new, more empirical and naturalistic approach than that of the Greeks or D̲j̲ābir, and he brought the same empirical spirit to medicine. Immersed in the Galenic tradition, and apparently even conversant with Greek (al-Bīrūnī ascribes to him translations and abridgements from the Greek and even a poem “in the Greek language”), al-Rāzī greatly profited from the Arabic translations of Greek medical and philosophical texts. He headed the hospital of Rayy before assuming the corresponding post in Bag̲h̲dād. His property in the vicinity seems to have brought him back often to Rayy, and he died there, somewhat embittered and alienated, partly by the loss of his eyesight. Like many of the great physicians of Islam, al-Rāzī was a courtier as well as a scholar, clinician and teacher. His medical handbook the <span><i>Manṣūrī</i></span>, translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century, was dedicated to Manṣūr b. Isḥāḳ, the Sāmānid governor of Rayy; his <span><i>Mulūkī</i></span> or <span><i>Regius</i></span>, to ʿAlī b. Wāhsūd̲h̲ān of Ṭabaristān. The author of some two hundred books, al-Rāzī claims in his apologia, the <span><i>Sīra al-falsafiyya</i></span>, or “Philosophical Way of Life”, that his has been a life of moderation, excessive only in his devotion to learning; he associated with princes never as a man at arms or an officer of state but always, and only, as a physician and a friend. He was constantly writing. In one year, he urges, he wrote over twenty thousand pages, “in a hand like an amulet maker’s.” Others remark on his generosity and compassion, seeing that the poor among his patients were properly fed and given adequate nursing care. Arriving patients first saw an outer circle of disciples, and then an inner circle, if these could not aid them, leaving al-Rāzī himself to treat the hardest cases. His medical research was similarly methodical, as revealed in his notebooks. These were edited, in some 25 volumes, as the <span><i>K. al-Ḥāwī fi ’l-ṭibb</i></span>, at the instance of Ibn al-ʿAmīd [<span><i>q.v.</i></span>], the vizier of Rukn al-Dawla [<span><i>q.v.</i></span>].Translated as the <span><i>Continens</i></span> in 1279 by the Jewish physician Farad̲j̲ b. Sālim (known as Farraguth) for King Charles of Anjou, it was printed at Brescia in 1486 and repeatedly thereafter. The text (Ḥaydarābād 1955) contains al-Rāzī’s extensive notes from a wide range of sources, organised anatomically, from head to toe. His own clinical observations, often at variance with received opinions, typically close the sections. Al-Rāzī mined these files for his numerous medical works, and several unfinished works can be discerned in the <span><i>Ḥāwī</i></span> <span><i> in</i></span> embryo. His magnum opus, the <span><i>Kitāb al-D̲j̲āmiʿ al-kabīr</i></span>, or “Great Medical Compendium”, often confused with the <span><i>Ḥāwī</i></span>, was a work that al-Rāzī published, not the corpus of his private files. Among the most famous of his medical writings are those on <span><i>Stones</i></span> <span><i> in the kidney and bladder</i></span> (<span><i>K. al-Ḥaṣā fi ’l-kulā wa ’l-mat̲h̲āna</i></span>) and <span><i>Smallpox</i></span><span><i> and measles</i></span> ( <span><i>K. al-D̲j̲adarī wa ’l-ḥaṣba</i></span> ). The latter was the first book on smallpox, and was translated over a dozen times into Latin and other European languages. Its lack of dogmatism and its Hippocratic reliance on clinical observation typify al-Rāzī’s medical methods. His independent mind is strikingly revealed in his  <span><i>S̲h̲ukūk ʿalā D̲j̲alīnūs</i></span> or “Doubts about Galen”. Here al-Rāzī rejects claims of Galen’s, from the alleged superiority of the Greek language to many of his cosmological and medical views. He places medicine within philosophy, inferring that sound practice demands independent thinking. His own clinical records, he reports, do not confirm Galen’s descriptions of the course of a fever. And in some cases he finds that his clinical experience exceeds Galen’s. He rejects the notion, central to the theory of humours, that the body is warmed or cooled only by warmer or cooler bodies; for a warm drink may heat the body to a degree much hotter than its own. Thus the drink must trigger a response rather than simply communicating its own warmth or coldness. This line of criticism has the potential, in time, to bring down the whole theory of humours and the scheme of the four elements, on which it was grounded. Al-Rāzī’s alchemy, like his medical thinking, struggles within the cocoon of hylomorphism. It dismisses the idea of potions and dispenses with an appeal to magic, if magic means reliance on symbols as causes. But al-Rāzī does not reject the idea that there are wonders in the sense of unexplained phenomena in nature. His alchemical stockroom, accordingly, is enriched with the products of Persian mining and manufacture, and the Chinese discovery, sal ammoniac. Still reliant on the idea of dominant forms or essences and thus on the Neoplatonic conception of causality as inherently intellectual rather than mechanical, al-Rāzī s alchemy nonetheless brings to the fore such empiric qualities as salinity and inflammability—the latter ascribed to “oiliness” and “sulphuriousness”. Such properties are not readily explained by the traditional fire, water, earth and air schematism, as al-G̲h̲azālī and other later comers, primed by thoughts like al-Rāzī’s, were quick to note.</p>
<p>Like Galen, al-Rāzī was speculatively interested in the art and profession of medicine. He wrote essays on such subjects as “The reasons for people’s preference of inferior physicians,” “A mistaken view of the function of the physician,” “Why some people leave a physician if he is intelligent,” “That an intelligent physician cannot heal all diseases, since that is not possible,” and “Why ignorant physicians, common folk, and women in the cities are more successful than scientists in treating certain diseases—and the physician’s excuse for this.” He also shared Galen’s interest in philosophy and heeded his treatise, “That the outstanding physician must also be a philosopher.” Al-Bīrūnī lists some eighty philosophical titles in his al-Rāzī bibliography, and al-Nadīm lists dozens of his works on logic, cosmology, theology, mathematics and alchemy. Given the general repugnance toward al-Rāzī’s philosophical ideas among his contemporaries and medieval successors, few of these works were copied. But fragments survive in quotations by later authors, as do the  <span><i>Sīra al-falsafiyya</i></span> and the  <span><i>Ṭibb al-rūḥānī</i></span> , the “Spiritual physick” or “Psychological medicine,” which embodies al-Rāzī’s largely Epicurean ethical system. Among the writings of which we have mention are: a commentary on Plato’s   <span><i>Timaeus</i></span> , perhaps based on the epitome of Galen, a rebuttal of Iamblichus’ response to Porphyry’s   <span><i>Letter</i></span>  <span><i> to </i></span>  <span><i>Anebos</i></span> (that is, the <span><i>De mysteriis</i></span>), an appraisal of the Ḳurʾān, a critique of Muʿtazilism, another on the infallible Ismāʿīlī Imām, a work on how to measure intelligence, an introduction to and vindication of algebra, a defence of the incorporeality of the soul, a debate with a Manichaean, and an explanation of the difficulty people have in accepting the sphericity of the earth when they are not trained in rigorous demonstration. Other works deal with eros, coitus, nudity and clothing, the fatal effects of the Simoom (or simply, of poisons,  <span><i>sumūm</i></span> , cf. Sezgin, <span><i>GAS</i></span>, iii, 289 no. 32) on animal life, the seasons of autumn and spring, the wisdom of the Creator, and the reason for the creation of savage beasts and reptiles. One work defends the proposition that God does not interfere with the actions of other agents. Another rebuts the claim that the earth revolves. Al-Rāzī discussed the innate or intrinsic character of motion, a sensitive point at the juncture between Democritean and Aristotelian physics. He wrote several treatments of the nature of matter, and one on the unseen causes of motion. His exposé of the risks of ignoring the axioms of geometry may aim at  <span><i>kalām</i></span> defenders of dimensionless atoms; and his book on the diagonal of the square may have defended his own atomism against the ancient charge, first levelled at Pythagoreanism, that atomism is refuted by the demonstrated incommensurability of a square’s side with its diagonal; for al-Rāzī’s acceptance of the void and rejection of Aristotle’s doctrine of the relativity of space disarms that charge, since al-Rāzī’s absolute space is a Euclidean continuum and need not, like his matter, be composed of discrete, indivisible quanta.</p>",1

Heinrichs.","Abu ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Muḥammad</span> b. <em>al</em>-Ḥusayn <em>al</em>-Azdī <em>al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> <em>al</em>-Naysābūrī, important Ṣūfī hagiographer and Ḳurʾān commentator. He was born at Nīs̲h̲āpūr (Naysābūr) in 325/937 or 330/942 and died in the same city in 412/1021. He belonged to the tribe of the Azd on his father’s side and to that of the Sulaym on his mother’s. When <em>al</em>-Sulamī’s father left Nīs̲h̲āpūr to settle at Mecca, <em>al</em>-Sulamī’s education was entrusted to his maternal grandfather, Abū ʿAmr Ismāʿīl b. Nud̲j̲ayd (d. 366/976-7), who was a disciple of Abū ʿUt̲h̲mān <em>al</em>-Ḥīrī (d. 298/910), a S̲h̲āfiʿī scholar of   <span><i>ḥadīt̲h̲</i></span>  and an adherent of the ascetic tradition of Nīs̲h̲āpūr. <em>Al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> received a teaching certificate (  <span><i>id̲j̲āza</i></span>  ) from the Ḥanafī Abū Sahl <em>al</em>-Ṣuʿlūkī (296-369/909-80) and, some time after 340/951, the Ṣūfī cloak (  <span><i>k̲h̲irḳa</i></span>  ) from the S̲h̲āfiʿī Abu ’l-Ḳāsim <em>al</em>-Naṣrābād̲h̲ī (d. 367/977-8) who, some ten years before in 330/942, had become a Ṣūfī at the hands of Abū Bakr <em>al</em>-S̲h̲iblī [<span><i>q.v.</i></span>] at Bag̲h̲dād.</p>  <p>An avid student of <span><i>ḥadīt̲h̲</i></span>, <em>al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> travelled widely throughout K̲h̲urāsān and ʿIrāḳ in search of knowledge, visiting Marw and Bag̲h̲dād for extended periods of time. He travelled as far as the Ḥid̲j̲āz, but apparendy visited neither Syria nor Egypt. His travels climaxed in a pilgrimage to Mecca, performed in 366/976 in the company of <em>al</em>-Naṣrābād̲h̲ī, who died shortly after the Pilgrimage. When <em>al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> returned to Nīs̲h̲āpūr about 368/977-8, his teacher Ismāʿīl b. Nud̲j̲ayd had passed away, leaving him his extensive library. This library became the centre of the small Ṣūfī lodge (  <span><i>duwayra</i></span>  ) which <em>al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> established in his quarter of the town, the   <span><i>sikkat <em>al</em>-Nawand</i></span>  . There he spent the remaining forty years of his life as a resident scholar, probably visiting Bag̲h̲dād on a number of occasions. By his later years, he had become highly respected throughout K̲h̲urāsān as a S̲h̲āfiʿī man of learning, and an author of Ṣūfī manuals.</p>  <p><em>Al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> was a prolific author who eventually employed his future biographer, Abū Saʿīd Muḥammad b. ʿAlī <em>al</em>-K̲h̲as̲h̲s̲h̲āb (381-456/991-1064), as his attendant and scribe. He composed the long list of his works, amounting to more man a hundred titles, over a period of some fifty years from about 360/970 onwards. Some thirty of his works are known to be extant in manuscript; many have appeared in print. These writings may be divided into three main categories: Ṣūfī hagiographies, Ṣūfī commentaries on the Ḳurʾān, and treatises on Ṣūfī traditions and customs. Each of these categories appears to be represented by a major work.</p>  <p>The substantial   <span><i>Taʾrīk̲h̲ <em>al</em>-Ṣūfīyya</i></span>  , listing the biographies of a thousand Ṣūfīs, is known only through extracts incorporated in later sources. It was probably an amplified version of the <span><i>Taʾrīk̲h̲</i></span> of Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh <em>al</em>-Bad̲j̲alī, known as Ibn S̲h̲ād̲h̲ān <em>al</em>-Rāzī, who died in 376/986 at Nīs̲h̲āpūr. The   <span><i>Ṭabaḳāt <em>al</em>-ṣūfiyya</i></span>  (ed. J. Pedersen, Leiden 1960, and N. S̲h̲arība, Cairo 1969) is a shorter version, listing summary biographies of 105 Ṣūfīs with selections of their sayings. The writings of <em>al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> on Ṣūfī traditions and customs, often referred to as   <span><i>Sunan</i></span>    <span><i><em>al</em>-ṣūfiyya</i></span>, are lost today. Extracts of its contents were integrated into the major works of Abū Bakr Aḥmad b. <em>al</em>-Ḥusayn <em>al</em>-Bayhaḳī (d. 458/1066). Judging by these extracts, <em>al</em>-Sulamī’s <span><i>Sunan</i></span> probably resembled a variety of minor treatises on Ṣūfī practices. His principal commentary on the Ḳurʾān,   <span><i>Ḥaḳāʾiḳ <em>al</em>-tafsīr</i></span>  , is a voluminous work which still awaits publication as a whole, although extracts of it have been published by Massignon and Nwyia. Some time after the completion of the <span><i>Ḥaḳāʾiḳ <em>al</em>-tafsīr</i></span>, <em>al</em>-<em>Sulamī</em> wrote a separate Ḳurʾān commentary entitled   <span><i>Ziyādāt ḥaḳāʾiḳ <em>al</em>-tafsīr</i></span>  (ed. G. Böwering, Beirut 1995), an appendix to the former extant in a unique manuscript. This work was compiled some time after 370/980, the date by which, in all probability, the <span><i>Ḥaḳāʾiḳ <em>al</em>-tafsīr</i></span> had been completed. Significant portions of both Ḳurʾān commentaries were integrated into the   <span><i>ʿArāʾis <em>al</em>-bayān fī ḥaḳāʾiḳ <em>al</em>-Ḳurʾān</i></span>  (2 vols., Cawnpore 1301/1884) of Abū Muḥammad Rūzbihān <em>al</em>-Baḳlī (d. 606/1209).</p>",1

The date and location of his birth are unknown, but according to his name it appears as though he was Arab.  His nisba, al-Mālīnī, signifies that he is from the village of Mālīn located about 12 miles from the city of Herat in modern-day Afghanistan.  We do find information in our sources that mention al-Mālīnī undertook significant travels in search of knowledge and visited: Khurāsān, Khuzastān, Transoxiana, Nīsābūr, the Ḥijāz, Iṣbahān, Fārs, Jurjān, Rayy, Baṣra, Baghdād, Kūfa, Shāmāt [i.e. Syria and Damascus], and Miṣr.  On these journeys he would visit with scholars and Sufis in mosques and various lodges and would write a significant amount.  although he was labelled as trustworthy, reliable, good, and righteous, we do find many small errors in the current work, primarily mistakes related to the names of individuals in the various isnads he used.  In some sources we see the epithet al-Ṣūfī added to his name, indicating that at least some scholars perceived him to be a part of this group, whether or not he actually considered himself to be.  He died on Tuesday, the 17th day of the Islamic month Shawwāl in the year 412 in Miṣr, where he had settled down after his travels.",0

Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.","(the wool-carder), <span class=""small-caps"">Abu ’l-Mug̲h̲īt̲h̲ al-Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr b. Maḥammā al-Bayḍāwī</span> , Arabic-speaking mystic theologian (244-309/857-922). His life, his teaching and his death throw light on a crucial period in the history of Muslim culture, and the interior experience which he describes can be considered a turning point in the history of <span><i>taṣawwuf</i></span> . (This article includes, as well as the article of <span><i>EI</i></span> <span><sup>1</sup></span>, some extensive additions drawn from the later works of L. Massignon).</p>
<p> Al-Ḥallād̲j̲ was born in about 244/857-8 at Ṭūr, to the north-east of al-Bayḍā in Fars. In Ṭūr an Iranian dialect was spoken; al-Bayḍā was an Arabized town where Sībawayh was born. It is said that al-Ḥallād̲j̲ was the grandson of a <span><i>gabr</i></span> and a descendant of Abū Ayyūb, the Companion of the Prophet. His father, who was probably a woolcarder, left Ṭūr for the textile region which extended from Tustar to Wāsiṭ (on the Tigris), a town founded by Arabs, with a predominantly Sunnī-Ḥanbalī population (with, in the country districts, an extremist S̲h̲īʿī minority), and the centre of a famous school of Ḳurʾān readers. At Wāsiṭ, al-Ḥusayn lost the ability to speak Persian. Before he was 12 years old, he learned the Ḳurʾān by heart and became a <span><i>ḥāfiẓ</i></span> . He very early attempted to find an inner meaning in the teaching of the <span><i>sūra</i></span> s and applied himself to <span><i>taṣawwuf</i></span> at the school of Sahl al-Tustarī.</p> <p>At Baṣra. When he was twenty he left Tustarī to go to Baṣra. There he received the habit of the Ṣūfīs from ʿAmr Makkī, and married Umm al-Ḥusayn, the daughter of Abū Yaʿḳūb al-Aḳṭaʿ. He did not take any other wives and he and his wife remained united all their lives, having at least three sons and one daughter. His marriage earned him the jealousy and the opposition of ʿAmr Makkī. When he was absent from home, al-Ḥallād̲j̲ was able to entrust the support of his family to his brotherin-law, a Karnabāʾī. Through the latter, he found himself in contact with a clan which supported the Zaydī rebellion of the Zand̲j̲ [<span><i>q.v.</i></span>], who were contaminated in varying degrees by S̲h̲īʿī extremism; this is probably the origin of his persistent but unfounded reputation as being a S̲h̲īʿī <span><i>dāʿī</i></span> or “missionary preacher”. He retained from this period some curious and apparently S̲h̲īʿī expressions, but continued to lead at Baṣra a fervently ascetic life and to remain profoundly faithful to Sunnism. He went to Bag̲h̲dād to consult the famous Ṣūfī Ḏj̲unayd, but in spite of the latter’s advice, tired of the conflict which existed between his father-in-law al-Aḳṭaʿ and ʿAmr Makkī, he set off for Mecca immediately after the Zand̲j̲ rebellion had been crushed.</p> <p>First Pilgrimage. At Mecca he made his first Pilgrimage, and made a vow to remain for one year of <span><i>ʿumra</i></span> in the courtyard of the sanctuary, in a state of perpetual fasting and silence. In this he was trying out his personal way to union with God, and, going against the discipline of secrecy, began to proclaim it. ʿAmr Makkī then broke off relations with him, yet he began to attract disciples.</p> <p> K̲h̲ūzistān, K̲h̲urāsān and departure from Tustar. Having returned to K̲h̲ūzistān, he gave up the tunic of the Ṣūfīs and adopted the “lay” habit (probably the <span><i>ḳabā</i></span> , a cloak worn by soldiers), in order to be able to speak and preach more freely. This beginning of his apostolate, the main aim of which was to enable everyone to find God within his own heart, and which earned for him the name of <span><i>Ḥallād̲j̲ al-Asrār</i></span> , “the carder of consciences”, exposed him to suspicion and hatred and scandalized the Ṣūfīs. Some Sunnīs former Christians some of whom were to become viziers at Bag̲h̲dād, became his disciples. But some Muʿtazilīs and some S̲h̲īʿīs, who were important treasury officials, accused him of deception and of false miracles and incited the mob against him. He left for K̲h̲urāsān to continue his preaching among the Arab colonies of eastern Iran and remained there for five years, preaching in the cities and staying for some time on the frontiers in the fortified monasteries which housed the volunteer fighters in the “Holy War”. He returned to the region of Tustar, and, with the help of the Secretary of State, Ḥamd Ḳunnāʾī, was able to instal his family in Bag̲h̲dād.</p> <p>Second Pilgrimage, distant journeys, Third Pilgrimage. With four hundred of his disciples, he then made his second pilgrimage to Mecca, where some of his former friends, Ṣūfīs, accused him of magic and sorcery and of making a pact with the <span><i>d̲j̲inns</i></span> . It was after this second <span><i>ḥad̲j̲d̲j̲</i></span> that he undertook a long tour in India (Hinduism) and Turkestan (Manicheismand Buddhism), beyond the frontiers of the <span><i>dār al-Islām</i></span> . “Au delà de la Communauté musulmane, c’est à toute l’humanité qu’il pense pour lui communiquer ce curieux désir de Dieu, patient et pudique, qui dès lors le caractérise...” (L. Massignon). About 290/902, al-Ḥallād̲j̲ returned to Mecca for his third and last pilgrimage. He returned there clad in the <span><i>muraḳḳaʿa</i></span> , a piece of patched and motley cloth thrown round his shoulders, and a <span><i>fūṭa</i></span> , an Indian loin-cloth, round his waist. His prayer at the station of ʿArafāt was that God should reduce him to nothing, should make him despised and rejected, so that God alone might grant grace to Himself through the heart and the lips of His servant.</p> <p>Final preaching at Bag̲h̲dād. After returning to his family at Bag̲h̲dād, he set up in his house a model of the <span><i>Kaʿba</i></span> , prayed at night beside tombs and in the daytime proclaimed in the streets or the <span><i>sūḳ</i></span> s his burning love of God and his desire “to die accursed for his Community”. “O Muslims, save me from God”... “God has made my blood lawful to you: kill me”... This preaching aroused popular emotion and caused anxiety among the educated classes. The Ẓāhirī Muḥammad b. Dāwūd was angry that al-Ḥallād̲j̲ should claim a mystical union with God; he denounced him at the court and demanded that he should be condemned to death. But the S̲h̲āfiʿī jurist Ibn Surayd̲j̲ maintained that mystic inspiration was beyond the jurisdiction of the courts, It was at this period that, according to the hostile account of the grammarians of Baṣra, al-Ḥallād̲j̲ replied to al-S̲h̲iblī, in the Mosque of al-Manṣūr, by the famous <span><i>s̲h̲aṭḥ</i></span> (“theopathic phrase”): <span><i>Ana ’l-ḥaḳḳ</i></span> , “I am [God] the Truth”, proclaiming that he had no other “I” than God.</p> <p> Arrest. A movement for the moral and political reform of the community was taking shape in Bag̲h̲dād, inspired by the preaching of al-Ḥallād̲j̲ and by those of the faithful who were anxious to see in him the hidden “Pole” of the time. He dedicated to Ibn Ḥamdān and to Ibn ʿĪsā some treatises on the duties of viziers. In 296/908, some Sunnī reformers (under the Ḥanbalī influence of al-Barbahārī, see H. Laoust, <span><i>La profession de foi d’ Ibn Baṭṭa</i></span> , Damascus 1958, <span><i>passim</i></span> ) made an unsuccessful attempt to seize power and to raise Ibn al-Muʿtazz to the caliphate. They failed, and the infant caliph, al-Muḳtadir, was restored, his vizier being the S̲h̲īʿī financier Ibn al-Furāt. Al-Ḥallād̲j̲ was involved in the consequent anti-Ḥanbalī repression and succeeded in fleeing to Sūs in Ahwāz, a Ḥanbalī town, although four of his disciples were arrested. Three years later, al-Ḥallād̲j̲ himself was arrested and brought back to Bag̲h̲dād, a victim of the hatred of the Sunnī Ḥāmid. He remained in prison for nine years.</p> <p> Imprisonment. In 301/913, the vizier Ibn ʿĪsā, the cousin of one of al-Ḥallād̲j̲’s disciples, put an end to the trial (cf. the <span><i>fatwā</i></span> of Ibn Surayd̲j̲) and the imprisoned supporters of al-Ḥallād̲j̲ were released. Nevertheless, owing to pressure from his enemies and the influence of the chief of police, who was an enemy of the vizier, al-Ḥallād̲j̲ was exposed for three days on the pillory with “Ḳarmaṭī agent” written above him. He was later confined in the palace, where he was able to preach to the ordinary prisoners. In 303/915, he cured the caliph of a fever, and in 305 “restored to life” the crown prince’s parrot. The Muʿtazilīs denounced his “charlatanism”. The vizier Ibn ʿĪsā, who had been favourable to al-Ḥallād̲j̲, was replaced in 304-6 by Ibn al-Furāt, who was anti-Ḥallād̲j̲, but the influence of the queen-mother prevented the latter from re-opening the trial. It appears that two of al-Ḥallād̲j̲’s most important works date from this period: the <span><i>Ṭā Sīn al-Azal</i></span> , a meditation on the case of Iblīs, “the disobedient monotheist”, and the short work on the “ascension” ( <span><i>miʿrād̲j̲</i></span> ) of Muḥammad, who halted on the threshold, two bow-shots from the Divine Essence.</p> <p>These meditations condemned Iblīs’s refusal and suggested that beyond the experience of Muḥammad there could be attained a union in love between man and God. They seem to have been a reply to the S̲h̲īʿī extremist al-S̲h̲almag̲h̲ānī, who considered that faith and impiety, virtue and vice, election and damnation were all <span><i>muḳābal</i></span> (“related opposites”) and equally pleasing to God. Al-S̲h̲almag̲h̲ānī had a considerable influence at the Bag̲h̲dād court and even on the course of the trial of al-Ḥallād̲j̲.</p> <p>The condemnation. The trial was re-opened and the case argued in 308-9/921-2. The background to it was Ḥāmid’s financial speculation, which had been opposed in vain by Ibn ʿĪsā. It was to destroy the latter’s influence that Ḥāmid procured the reopening of the trial of al-Ḥallād̲j̲. He was helped in this by Ibn Mud̲j̲āhid, the respected leader of the corporation of the Ḳurʾān readers and a friend of the Sūfīs Ibn Sālim and al-S̲h̲iblī but opposed to al-Ḥallād̲j̲. The Ḥanbalīs, at the instigation of Ibn ʿAṭāʾ, himself a Ḥanbalī and a mystic, held demonstrations and “prayed against” Ḥāmid: both in protest against his fiscal policy and in order to save al-Ḥallād̲j̲. They even demonstrated against al-Ṭabarī, who condemned the riot. These disorders gave the vizier Ḥāmid the opportunity to make Ibn ʿAṭāʾ appear before the tribunal. But Ibn ʿAṭāʾ refused to witness against al-Ḥallād̲j̲ and maintained that the vizier did not possess the right to judge the conduct of “holy men”. He was ill-treated by a guard during the court hearing and died from the blows he received.</p> <p>Ḥāmid and the Mālikī <span><i>ḳāḍī</i></span> Abū ʿUmar Ibn Yūsuf, who always supported those in power at the time, arranged in advance the judgement of the tribunal which was to condemn al-Ḥallād̲j̲. Al-Ḥallād̲j̲ had said “The important thing is to proceed seven times around the <span><i>Kaʿba</i></span> of one’s heart”: they therefore accused him of being a Ḳarmaṭī rebel who wished to destroy the <span><i>Kaʿba</i></span> of Mecca. There was no S̲h̲āfiʿī present at the trial. The Ḥanafī <span><i>ḳāḍī</i></span> declined to give judgement, but his assistant agreed to support Abū ʿUmar, and the syndic of the professional witnesses succeeded in producing eighty-four signatories. Sitting in judgement, Abū ʿUmar, urged by Ḥāmid, pronounced the formula: “It is lawful to shed your blood”.</p>
<p>The execution. For two days the grand chamberlain Naṣr and the queen-mother interceded with the caliph, who, stricken with a fever, countermanded the execution. But the intrigues of the vizier triumphed over the hesitation of al-Muḳtadir who, as he was leaving a great banquet, signed the warrant for al-Ḥallād̲j̲’s execution. On 23 D̲h̲u ’l-Ḳaʿda, the sounding of trumpets announced the impending execution. Al-Ḥallād̲j̲ was handed over to the chief of police, and in the evening in his condemned cell exhorted himself to face martyrdom and foresaw his glorious resurrection. These prayers, noted down and handed on, were to be re-grouped in the <span><i>Ak̲h̲bār al-Ḥallād̲j̲</i></span>
<p>On 24 D̲h̲u ’l-Ḳaʿda, at Bāb K̲h̲urāsān “before an enormous crowd”, al-Ḥallād̲j̲, with a crown on his head, was beaten, half-killed, and exposed, still alive, on a gibbet ( <span><i>ṣalīb</i></span> ). While rioters set fire to the shops, friends and enemies questioned him as he hung on the gibbet and traditions relate some of his replies. The caliph’s warrant for his decapitation did not arrive until nightfall, and in fact his final execution was postponed until the next day. During the night there spread accounts of wonders and supernatural happenings. In the morning, according to al-Tūzarī, those who had signed his condemnation, grouped around Ibn Mukram, cried out: “It is for Islam; let his blood be on our heads”. Al-Ḥallād̲j̲’s head fell, his body was sprinkled with oil and burned and the ashes thrown into the Tigris from the top of a minaret (27 March 922).</p> <p>Witnesses reported that the last words of the tortured man were: “All that matters for the ecstatic is that the Unique should reduce him to Unity”, recapitulating the appeal to the one authentic <span><i>tawḥīd</i></span> , that which God utters in the heart of His friends; and that he then recited Ḳurʾān, XLII, 18.</p>",1
14,Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. al-Khafīf,أبو عبد الله محمد بن الخفيف,Ibn Khafīf,ابن خفيف,372,"Sobieroj, Florian, “Ibn Khafīf”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. ","<p>Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad b. Khafīf b. Isfakshādh (Iskafshādh) al-Ḍabbī al-Shīrāzī (c.268–371/882–982), known as <span><b>Ibn Khafīf</b></span>, was a Ṣūfī, ascetic, and prolific writer of Shirazi origin with an Ashʿarī orientation. By virtue of his many encounters with the great masters, his immense achievements, and his long life, he was considered the “seal of Ṣūfism” (<span><i>khātam al-ṣūfiyya</i></span>; Junayd, 38–9).</p>
<p>His mother was of Nīshāpūrī descent, and his father, mostly absent, served as a Daylamī commander in the army of the Ṣaffārid ʿAmr b. Layth (r. 265–87/879–900) (al-Daylamī, <span><i>Sīrat</i></span>, 9) (the Ṣaffārids ruled 247/861 to 393/1003, and the centre of their power was in Sistan, with an empire extending at times into Persia and eastern Afghanistan; the Daylamīs inhabited the mountainous regions of northern Iran, on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, and were long employed as soldiers). Among the principal features of his spiritual method were renunciation, fasting, prayer, poverty, and a literalist observance of the Prophet’s Sunna (cf. Junayd, 44f.).</p>
<p>The main source on his life is the biography compiled by his disciple al-Daylamī (fl. late fourth/tenth century), extant as a Persian translation (presumed Arabic title <span><i>Sīrat Muḥammad b. Khafīf</i></span>) by Ibn Junayd Shīrāzī (eighth/fourteenth century; note that this a different person from the Junayd, who wrote after 791/1387, who is the author of <span><i>Shadd al-izār</i></span>) titled <span><i>Sīrat-i Abū ʿAbdallāh b. al-Khafīf al-Shīrāzī</i></span>. The exchange with the Ṣūfī masters he met—at home and on his extensive travels in Ḥijāz, Iraq, and Syria—is one of the major subjects of the <span><i>Sīrat</i></span>. Al-Daylamī names mystics with whom the youthful Ibn Khafīf associated in Fārs, such as the illiterate Muʾammil al-Jaṣṣāṣ (d. 322/933–4), who advised him to look for the saints during the <span><i>ḥajj</i></span>, behind Mount ʿArafa ( Jāmī, <span><i>Nafaḥāt</i></span>, 243); Jaʿfar al-Ḥadhdhāʾ, whom Bundār b. al-Ḥusayn (d. c.355/965) considered superior, in respect to the mystical state <span><i>(ḥāl)</i></span>, to the early Iraqi Ṣūfī al-Shiblī (d. 334/945) (Jāmī, 238), although Bundār had renounced the world under al-Shiblī’s influence; and al-ʿAtāyadī (“the model of salaried workers,” Jāmī, 238). He mentions Ṣūfīs who visited Ibn Khafīf in Shiraz, where he settled.</p>
<p>In Shiraz, Iṣṭakhr, Fasā, Wāsiṭ, Baghdad, and Basra (the latter in 300/912–3), Ibn Khafīf also met authorities in <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>, among them the prominent Persian historian and exegete of the Qurʾān al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923), whom he criticised polemically (<span><i>Iʿtiqād</i></span>, in Ibn Taymiyya, <span><i>Fatwā</i></span>, 47). He carried with him writing implements to record Prophetic traditions and routinely copied twenty traditions every night, after completing his litanies (al-Daylamī, <span><i>Treatise</i></span>, 208–9).</p>
<p>He made the <span><i>ḥajj</i></span> at least six times and also travelled to Mecca (not on the pilgrimage) in his mother’s company (Jāmī, 622), to visit the Ṣūfīs. He wore the <span><i>khirqa</i></span> (patched robe, symbolic of initiation into Ṣūfī life) that he had obtained from his mother, a follower of Karrāmī piety, whom he considered a saint (Jāmī, 622), and he would not exchange it for the Ṣūfī cloak offered to him by Ibn ʿAṭāʾ al-Ādamī (d. 309/921–2; al-Daylamī, <span><i>Treatise</i></span>, 92–3) (the Karrāmiyya is a movement with ascetic tendencies akin to Ṣūfism, founded by ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad b. Karrām, d. 255/869, in Persia). Ibn Khafīf did, however, accept the patched robe from his first master in Baghdad, Ruwaym al-Ẓāhirī (d. 303/915–6), a Ṣūfī turned judge (al-Daylamī, <span><i>Treatise</i></span>, 18). He also received a <span><i>khirqa</i></span> from al-Shiblī, although he did not include him among the models of spirituality whom he advised his novices to follow: “Imitate five of our teachers! As for the rest, listen to them but disregard what they say. The five are Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī (from Basra, d. 243/857); (three from Baghdad) al-Junayd, Abū Muḥammad Ruwaym (d. 303/915–6), Ibn ʿAṭāʾ (d. 309/922), and ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī (originally from Yemen, d. 297/910; cf. al-Anṣārī, <span><i>Ṭabaqāt</i></span>, 233).” As a reason for this selection, he explained that these five united exoteric knowledge and mysticism while the others were Ṣūfīs “overpowered by the mystical experience” (Junayd, 43–4). Ibn Khafīf criticised a contemporary for plagiarising the work of al-Muḥāsibī (d. 243/857)—founder of the Baghdad school of mysticism and teacher of such Ṣūfī masters as Junayd (al-Daylamī, <span><i>Treatise</i></span>, 114)—whose <span><i>Kitāb al-riʿāya li-ḥuqūq Allāh</i></span> (“The book of observing God’s due”) was transmitted by Ibn Khafīf’s disciples (Sobieroj, <span><i>Novizenerziehung</i></span>, 219). In Baghdad, Ibn Khafīf saw al-Ḥallāj (d. 309/922), the highly controversial “martyr of mystical love” (Schimmel) in prison, where he performed one of his miracles that convinced him of his sanctity (he called him <span><i>ʿālim rabbānī</i></span>, divine scholar; al-Sulamī, 308; ʿAṭṭār, <span><i>Tadhkirat</i></span>, 583). However, he cursed al-Ḥallāj for his <span><i>shaṭḥiyyāt</i></span> (ecstatic locutions) (al-Daylamī, <span><i>Treatise</i></span>, 101).</p>
<p>As a young man in Basra, Ibn Khafīf met the Iraqi scholar and theologian Abū l-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī (d. 324/935–6), founder of the Ashʿarī school of theology (Bell, <span><i>Treatise</i></span>, xxxiv–xl). According to an autobiographical account (cf. Ibn ʿAsākir, <span><i>Tabyīn</i></span>, 94–5), Ibn Khafīf became al-Ashʿarī’s student after observing how he outwitted the Muʿtazila in a debate (Ibn ʿAsākir, <span><i>Tabyīn</i></span>, 94–5; al-Subkī, 3:159–63, includes a long rhymed eulogy on al-Ashʿarī ascribed to Ibn Khafīf). According to a report by al-Bāqillānī (d. 403/1013), in which he claims that he met Ibn Khafīf teaching al-Ashʿarī’s <span><i>Kītāb al-lumaʿ</i></span> (“Book of Radiance”) in Shiraz, Ibn Khafīf worked to bring Ṣūfism and Ashʿarī theology together shortly before his death (cf. Sobieroj, <span><i>Novizenerziehung</i></span>, 220–1). This was despite his overall traditionalist orientation: his works on dogma, composed in accordance with the scripturalists (<span><i>ahl al-ḥadīth;</i></span> Ibn Taymiyya, <span><i>Fatwā</i></span>, 45), have been transmitted by Ḥanbalī authors (Sobieroj, <span><i>Novizenerziehung</i></span>, 243–8). When Ibn Khafīf died, at an age of perhaps one hundred four years (al-Subkī, 3:155), Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, as well as Muslims, participated in the funeral, everyone praying according to his own ritual (al-Daylamī, <span><i>Treatise</i></span>, 218).</p>
<p>Among his transmitters and disciples—al-Jullābī (247) calls the Ṣūfīs who followed his doctrine the Khafīfiyya—were several Ṣūfī authors who “benefited from his writings” (cf. al-Dhahabī, <span><i>Taʾrīkh</i></span>, 507; al-Subki, 3:151): Abū l-ʿAbbās al-Nasawī (d. 396/1005; Ibn ʿAsākir, <span><i>Taʾrīkh</i></span>, 7:303; al-Dhahabi, loc. cit., called him “al-Fasawī,” which appears to have been a scribal error); al-Daylamī (d. c.392/1001; his <span><i>Kitāb ʿAṭf al-alif al-maʾlūf</i></span>, “Book on love,” was transmitted by ʿAlī b. Bakrān al-Shīrāzī, another disciple of Ibn Khafīf (Bell, li)); Ibn Bākawayh (d. 428/1037; al-Dhahabī, <span><i>Siyar</i></span>, 17:544), collector of Ṣūfī stories; Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī (d. 412/1021), who received an <span><i>ijāza</i></span> (licence) from him to teach Prophetic and Ṣūfī traditions (al-Sulamī, 462, 464); and Abū Nuʿaym (d. 430/1038; Junayd, 42). Ḥusayn Akkār al-Fīrūzābādī (d. 391/1000–1) transmitted Ibn Khafīf’s <span><i>khirqa</i></span> to al-Kāzarūnī, a militant Ṣūfī and a major successor of Ibn Khafīf in Fārs (although he never met Ibn Khafīf); the “white garment of Junayd” is said to have been passed on to Kāzarūnī from Ibn Khafīf through ʿAbdallāh b. Bānīk (<span><i>Firdaws</i></span>, ed. <span><i>Ī</i></span>raj Afshār, Tehran 1358/1939, 103).</p>

Aḥmad b. Isḥāq b. Mūsā b. Mihrān al-Shāfiʿī <span><b>al-Iṣfahānī</b></span> (or al-Iṣbahānī) (336–430/948–1038), author of a biographical encyclopaedia of the great mystics of early Islam, reportedly descended from an Iranian family originally from Medea (al-Jibāl) that converted to Islam around the middle of the second/eighth century. Mihrān, his paternal ancestor, is said to have been a supporter of the Ṭālibī Jaʿfarid ʿAbdallāh b. Muʿāwiya (d. 129/746–7), who had taken Isfahan from the Umayyads in 127/744 (Ibn Khallikān, <span><i>Wafayāt</i></span>, vol. 1, no. 33). The Umayyads recaptured the city in 129/746, on the eve of the ʿAbbāsid uprising in Khurāsān in 130/747.</p>
<p>Abū Nuʿaym is best known as the author of <span><i>Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ wa-ṭabaqāt al-aṣfiyāʾ</i></span>, a vast compilation of prophetic utterances and traditions attributed to individuals from the earliest days of Islam onwards, who, according to Abū Nuʿaym, were regarded as ascetics and mystics. Strangely, Abū Nuʿaym connects the first four caliphs with this original mysticism, as well as a number of important personalities treated in the <span><i>Sīra</i></span>, and the <span><i>ahl al-ṣuffa</i></span> (<span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> 1:46–2:132). The Khurāsānī Abū Naṣr al-Sarrāj al-Ṭūsī (d. 378/988), in his <span><i>Lumaʿ</i></span> (132–4), had already ascribed to this group of Companions <span><i>(ṣaḥāba)</i></span> an adherence to a shared asceticism. The historical hypothesis is that these Companions, mostly young men and often members of desert tribes—e.g., Abū Hurayra (d. c.57/678)—could not find lodgings in Medina with allies of their tribe and so were lodged under a portico (Ar. <span><i>ṣuffa)</i></span> (see EI2 &amp; EI3 “Ahl al-Suffa”) in the vast courtyard connected to the Prophet’s quarters, in the heart of the Prophet's mosque in Medina. Ibn Saʿd (d. 230/845), in his <span><i>Ṭabaqāt</i></span> (vol. 1, see <span><i>Dhikr al-ṣuffa</i></span>), also mentions their destitution but without linking it to any ascetic motivation. Abū Nuʿaym—following some of his immediate predecessors—thus paints an ideological picture of the past that amounts to literary hagiography. In fact, unlike the classic <span><i>ṭabaqāt</i></span> of the time, the <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> does not provide precise and systematic biographical information. The identification of individuals—essential to evaluating the credibility of a transmitter—is in all cases inadequate, replaced by overblown praise. It is possible that Abū Nuʿaym, as an Iranian from Isfahan, aimed to surpass some older work written in the same style but with a less extensive content, for example, the <span><i>Ṭabaqāt al-ṣūfiyya</i></span> of al-Sulamī (d. 412/1021), himself a Khurāsānī, whose identification of individuals is more precise than Abū Nuʿaym’s. In a passage in the <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> (2:25) on individuals omitted by al-Sulamī, we find what may be traces of a rivalry on grounds both personal—despite the homage Abū Nuʿaym pays to al-Sulamī (<span><i>Ḥilya</i></span>, 2:25)—and regional (Isfahan versus Nīshāpūr), as well as a tendency to extol figures who were deemed local mystics, as in the long entry devoted to Muḥammad b. Yūsuf al-Iṣfahānī (an individual not mentioned by al-Sulamī; <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span>, 8:225–37, no. 400). In matters of mystical hagiography, Abū Nuʿaym also refers to another precursor (<span><i>Ḥilya</i></span>, 2:25), the Basran Abū Saʿd b. al-Aʿrābī (d. 341/952), who is said to have compiled the <span><i>Ṭabaqāt al-nussāk</i></span> (this work is lost; on Abū Saʿd, see <span><i>GAS</i></span> 1:660).</p>
<p>Despite its methodological shortcomings, the reputation of the <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> lasted throughout the Muslim Middle Ages. The compilation is frequently cited and used by later authors. The Baghdadi Ḥanbalī scholar Ibn al-Jawzī (d. 597/1200), in the introduction to his <span><i>Ṣafwat</i></span>
<span><i>(Ṣifat) al-Ṣafwa</i></span>, was not the first to present himself immediately as the direct successor to Abū Nuʿaym. At the same time, however, he criticsed harshly the reliability of certain transmissions related by Abū Nuʿaym. Of course this prolific author and polemicist of the sixth/twelfth century could not ignore the serious quarrel between the Shāfiʿī Abū Nuʿaym and the Ḥanbalī faction of Isfahan, led by the Banū Manda family, specifically Muḥammad b. Isḥāq (d. 395/1005) and his sons (<span><i>GAS</i></span> 1:214; Ibn Abī Yaʿlā, <span><i>Ṭabaqāt al-Ḥanābila</i></span>, no. 630). We also find a short and highly critical biography by Abū Nuʿaym himself, sketching the doctrinal errors of his rival, written at the end of his rival’s life, after his extensive travels “in search of science <span><i>(ḥadīth)</i></span>,” after his return to Isfahan (<span><i>Dhikr akhbār Iṣbāhān</i></span>, 2:306).</p>
<p>The second most famous work by Abū Nuʿaym, the <span><i>Dhikr akhbār Iṣbāhān</i></span> (<span><i>Taʾrīkh Iṣbāhān</i></span>, according to Ibn Khallikān, <span><i>Wafayāt</i></span>, no. 33) is a literary inventory of the transmitters of traditions (always with the intention of evaluating the credibility of their <span><i>isnād</i></span>s) who are considered to be connected with particular cities, because they were born there, resided there, or died there. This, with the <span><i>Taʾrīkh Naysābūr</i></span> by al-Ḥākim al-Naysābūrī (d. 405/1014), is one of the oldest works of its kind, preceding the monumental <span><i>Taʾrīkh Baghdād</i></span> by al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī (d. 463/1071) (for a bibliography on the histories of scholars of particular cities, see <span><i>GAS</i></span> 339f., although the approach there is insufficiently critical).</p>
<p>Abū Nuʿaym’s mediaeval biographers agree that he was descended from a scholarly family that had been interested in mysticism for several generations, but this representation is probably based at least partly on Abū Nuʿaym’s reputation and not on historical fact. In the introduction to his literary compilation on mysticism, Abū Nuʿaym portrays himself as the grandson of an ascetic who is said to have had many disciples, a certain Muḥammad b. Yūsuf al-Bannāʾ (<span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> 1:4, attesting to his descent; also <span><i>Dhikr akhbār Iṣbāhān</i></span>, 2:220). One of the last entries of the <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> is also dedicated to this Muḥammad b. Yūsuf b. Maʿdān al-Bannāʾ (not to be confused with his partial namesake Muḥammad b. Yūsuf al-Iṣbāhānī, an ascetic of the middle of the second/eighth century, <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> 8, no. 400, and <span><i>Dhikr akhbār Iṣbāhān</i></span>, 2:249). This ancestor of Abū Nuʿaym, who, according to Ibn Khallikān was his father’s maternal grandfather (Wafayāt, no. 33, Dhahabī, <span><i>Tadhkira</i></span> no. 993), is called contradictorily in the <span><i>Dhikr akhbār Iṣbāhān</i></span> (2:220) “the grandfather of my father,” without further specification, and in the <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> (1:4) <span><i>jaddī</i></span>, which, in this case, should not be taken literally to mean “grandfather”, but grandfather of a further generation; he is not cited in other inventories of mystics contemporary with that of Abū Nuʿaym. One should take with a grain of salt the Abū Nuʿaym’s portrayal of him as a reputable transmitter of traditions, notably those gathered during a pilgrimage to Mecca, which he is said to have performed in 245/858, because Abū Nuʿaym refers to the authority of an unspecified book by Abū Muḥammad b. Ḥayyān (about him, <span><i>Akhbār Iṣbāhān,</i></span> 2:90 ʿAbd Allāh b. Muḥammad b. Jaʿfar b. Ḥayyān known as Abū al-Shaykh d. 369/979), who was allegedly one of Abū Nuʿaym’s masters (al-Dhahabī, <span><i>Tadhkira</i></span>, no. 993, sub Abū al-Shaykh b. Ḥayyān). Ibn Ḥayyān describes Muḥammad b. Yūsuf as a Ṣūfī “whose invocations are heard” <span><i>(mustajāb al-daʿwa)</i></span>, a sacred expression used in pietistic circles, and as the author of “beautiful writings,” <span><i>kutub ḥisān.</i></span> But none of these writings is named, and apparently no trace of them remains. The short biography that Ibn al-Jawzī devotes to this individual in his <span><i>Ṣafwat</i></span> (no. 666) is far more modest. He is presented as a <span><i>muftī</i></span>, an important transmitter of traditions who vowed to search for knowledge, renouncing all riches, during his pilgrimage to Mecca. He is portrayed simply as a pious believer <span><i>(min al-mutadayyinīn al-atqiyāʾ)</i></span>.</p>
<p>Abū Nuʿaym himself adhered to the Shāfiʿī school of law, which was not introduced in Isfahān until the third/ninth century, by Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad b. ʿĀṣim (d. 299/911) (Halm, 147). Tāj al-Dīn al-Subkī (d. 771/1370) devotes an entry of average length to Abū Nuʿaym in his <span><i>Ṭabaqāt al-Shāfiʿiyya</i></span> (no. 253 of the fourth <span><i>ṭabaqa</i></span>). He characterises him as a <span><i>ḥāfiẓ</i></span>, a “great transmitter (of <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>).” He had been granted this epithet before, by the Syrian historian and theologian Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748/1348) in his <span><i>Tadhkirat al-ḥuffāẓ</i></span> (no. 993), in which he lavishes praise on Abū Nuʿaym as the “[main] transmitter of his time” <span><i>(muḥaddith al-ʿaṣr)</i></span>. He also accords him the title of “Ṣūfī,” as would al-Subkī later. It is clear, however, that Abū Nuʿaym acquired this epithet for the reputation he built with his <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> and not as a consequence of any mystical activity or practice. With similar hyperbole, al-Dhahabī states that Abū Nuʿaym studied with 430 masters, of whom he lists only four, each based in a different centre of learning, Wāsiṭ and Baghdad in Iraq, Nīshāpūr in Khurāsān, and Damascus. On the other hand, he does cite an important number of “auditors,” who are said to have studied the traditions transmitted by him and who were from the most diverse and remote regions, including al-Andalus and Sicily. Al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, a celebrity of the next generation, purportedly was one of his auditors. Al-Dhahabī states that al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī (d. 463/1071) lauded Abū Nuʿaym’s qualities as a transmitter and admired the composition of the <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span> even more. At the same time, however, he is said to have accused Abū Nuʿaym of a certain laxity <span><i>(tasāhul)</i></span> with regard to the <span><i>isnād</i></span>s he used. Al-Dhahabī rejects this in his introduction to the <span><i>Tadhkira;</i></span> Ibn Ḥajar (d. 852/1449), in his <span><i>Lisān al-Mīzān</i></span> (s.v. Aḥmad b. ʿAbdallāh), copies verbatim al-Dhahabī’s view, transcribing the text from another biographical work by al-Dhahabī, <span><i>Mīzān al-iʿtidāl</i></span> (no. 420). Al-Subkī wrongly refers to al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī as “one of Abū Nuʿaym’s closest disciples.” He is then amazed that the former did not devote an entry to his master in the <span><i>Taʾrīkh Baghdād</i></span>, something he attributes to ingratitude (al-Subkī was wrong: Abū Nuʿaym is mentioned in <span><i>Taʾrīkh</i></span>, 12:409, 412). According to al-Subkī, Abū Nuʿaym was not mentioned either in the <span><i>Dhayl</i></span> (supplement) to the <span><i>Taʾrīkh Baghdād</i></span>, composed by ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Samʿānī (d. 562/1166).</p>
<p>Abū Nuʿaym’s later biographers even consider one episode of his life to be “miraculous,” that is, one of the <span><i>karāmāt</i></span> (al-Subkī, <span><i>Ṭabaqāt</i></span>, no. 253; and the modern Azharī scholar Yūsuf b. Ismāʿīl al-Nabhānī, d. after 1345/1926, who, in his <span><i>Jāmiʿ karāmāt al-awliyāʾ</i></span>, 1:293, describes a double “miracle” attesting to Abū Nuʿaym’s supernatural powers). After the Ḥanbalīs of Isfahan, on the fringes of Abū Nuʿaym’s quarrel with the Banū Manda family, banned him from all public teaching venues, in particular the Great Mosque, he reportedly escaped the massacre of the crowd that had assembled there for Friday prayers in 420/1029. This massacre was carried out on the order of Masʿūd b. Maḥmūd al-Ghaznawī, who had been sent by his father to avenge the governor who had been appointed after the conquest of the city and who had been murdered by the rebellious population.</p>
<p>Abū Nuʿaym is sometimes classified among the Ashʿarīs, perhaps because al-Dhahabī, in the introduction to his <span><i>Tadhkira</i></span>, recounts the discord that existed in Isfahan between “the Ashʿarīs and the Ḥanbalīs.” There is, however, no evidence that Abū Nuʿaym had ever received any theological education, Ashʿarī or otherwise.</p>
<p>In addition to his two main works, Abū Nuʿaym is named as the author of several works listed in the <span><i>Tadhkira</i></span>, some of which have come down to us (<span><i>GAL</i></span> 1:362, <span><i>GALS</i></span> 1:616). These writings, which are closely connected to his competence as a traditionist, include <span><i>al-Musnad al-mustakhraj ʿalā Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim</i></span>, <span><i>Dalāʾil al-nubuwwa, K. Maʿrifat al-ṣaḥāba</i></span>, and <span><i>Ṭibb al-nabī</i></span>.</p>
<p>Abū Nuʿaym shares status as a great traditionist <span><i>(ḥāfiẓ)</i></span> with many masters of his time, but it is mainly on account of the <span><i>Ḥilya</i></span>—crammed with often miraculous anecdotes and capturing his readers’ imagination—that a posthumous reputation developed that has largely obscured his historical personality.</p>",0

18,Abū Naṣr Muḥammad al-Fārābī,أبو نصر محمد الفارابي,al-Fārābī,الفارابي,339,"Janos, Damien, “al-Fārābī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.","<p>Abū Naṣr Muḥammad <span><b>al-Fārābī</b></span> (d. 339/950), sometimes referred to as the “Second Teacher” in the Arabic tradition (after the “First Teacher,” Aristotle), was one of the foremost Arabic philosophers of the early, classical Islamic period. He was a polymath who wrote on a wide variety of topics, ranging from music, astronomy, astrology, and geometry, to physics, metaphysics, ethics, and the historical evolution of philosophy and religion. He had a decisive impact on the development of Arabic logic, cosmology, and metaphysics in particular, and his works are cited by luminaries as varied as Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna, d. 428/1037), Ibn Bājja (d. 533/1139), Ibn Rushd (Averroës, d. 594/1198), and Maimonides (d. 600/1204). He was also known in mediaeval Europe through Latin and Hebrew translations of some of his works made during the sixth/twelfth and seventh/thirteenth centuries. In view of his contributions to the formation of an Arabic philosophical curriculum and of his intellectual originality, al-Fārābī stands out as one of the foundational figures of Arabic thought, when Greek science and philosophy were undergoing a slow and sustained process of assimilation and transformation in learned circles throughout the Islamic world.</p>
<p>In spite of the extensive accounts on al-Fārābī found in some Arabic bio-bibliographic sources, little reliable information about his life can be retrieved from these works. This evidence has already been thoroughly examined (notably by Gutas, Biography; Vallat, <span><i>Farabi et l’école d’Alexandrie</i></span>; and Rudolph, Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī).</p>
<p>Abū Naṣr Muḥammad b. Muḥammad b. Muḥammad b. Ṭarkhān al-Fārābī, as he is called by one of the earliest sources, Ibn al-Nadīm’s <span><i>Fihrist</i></span> (263), was born in about 256/870 into a family that was originally from Khurāsān or Transoxania. It is unclear whether—and if so, when—he migrated west to Baghdad, the capital of the ʿAbbāsid caliphate. The issue of al-Fārābī’s ethnic and cultural background is also debated: his name could be of either Persian or Turkic origin. At any rate, he was active in Baghdad from the early fourth/tenth century to about 330/942, when he left for Syria and Egypt. He died in 338/950, in Damascus, after years of travel and teaching. The short narrative al-Fārābī wrote on his philosophical pedigree—as transmitted by the later bio-bibliographer Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa (d. 668/1270)—in which he traces the roots of his system back to Alexandria, has been shown to be inaccurate and fanciful to some degree (al-Fārābī, <span><i>Fī ẓuhūr</i></span>; Stroumsa; Gutas, Alexandria to Baghdad; Lameer, Alexandria to Baghdad). In spite of this, we know that al-Fārābī’s philosophy was shaped in the company of Syriac scholars, notably Yuḥannā b. Ḥaylān (fl. early fourth/tenth century) and possibly Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 329/940–1), and that he may also have studied grammar with Ibn al-Sarrāj (d. 316/928) in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Of the Christian scholars who contributed to al-Fārābī’s philosophical formation, Mattā is the most noteworthy. He was one of the leading Aristotelian philosophers of Baghdad during this time and was both a translator of and a commentator on Greek philosophical works (via Syriac). In this dual capacity, he presumably played a key role in introducing al-Fārābī to the thought of ancient and late antique authors, especially Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. 200 C.E.), Themistius (d. 387 C.E.), and Philoponus (d. 570 C.E.), as well as Aristotle, and in familiarising al-Fārābī with his own commentary-based approach. Not only are there striking parallels in the disciplines in which Mattā and al-Fārābī specialised (e.g., logic and cosmology or “celestial physics”) and in their predilection for the commentary format—there is also some degree of doctrinal overlap on specific issues they tackled in their works.</p>
<p>In the absence of more decisive evidence pointing to his possible visit to Ḥarrān, in present-day southern Turkey (for this hypothesis, see Vallat, <span><i>Farabi</i></span>, 17–25), we must assume that it is also in Baghdad that al-Fārābī consulted the various other Greco-Arabic sources that underlie many of his theories. In addition to much of the Aristotelian corpus, he probably had access to (a) Ptolemy’s <span><i>Almagest</i></span> and <span><i>Planetary hypotheses</i></span>; (b) Euclid’s <span><i>Elements</i></span> and commentaries on parts of it, as well as material derived from various other Alexandrian mathematical and astronomical treatises (possibly by Geminus, fl. first century B.C.E., Poseidonius, d. c. 51 B.C.E., Pappus of Alexandria, d. 350 C.E., and Theon of Alexandria, d. 405 C.E.); (c) several of Galen’s (d. 210 C.E.) medical works; (d) compendia of Platonic dialogues; (e) independent treatises, such as Alexander’s influential <span><i>On the principles of the cosmos</i></span>; and (f), sections of Neoplatonic works from both the Alexandrian and Athenian schools, translated and adapted into Arabic, especially the <span><i>Uthūlūjiyā Arisṭāṭālīs</i></span> (The theology of Aristotle), essentially an adaptation of Plotinus’s <span><i>Enneads</i></span>, books 4–6, and the <span><i>Kitāb fī maḥḍ al-khayr</i></span> (“Book of pure good”), an adaptation of Proclus’s <span><i>Elements of theology</i></span>. Although al-Fārābī’s philosophical approach may be connected primarily with the Alexandrian school of Ammonius, son of Hermeias (d. between 517 and 526 C.E.), he was probably familiar also with excerpts or doctrines from the works of Syrianus (d. c. 437 C.E.), Simplicius (d. c. 560 C.E.), and, especially, Proclus (d. 485 C.E.). The question of his knowledge of Theophrastus’s works has never been explored, although he surely knew of the existence of this philosopher.</p>
<p>Al-Fārābī himself taught a younger generation of Syriac scholars, chief among them Yaḥyā Ibn ʿAdī (d. 363/974). Again in this case, there is some continuity between the works of Yaḥyā and those of al-Fārābī, pointing to a general philosophical milieu in which Muslims, Jews, and Christians gathered and exchanged ideas freely and constructively, albeit sometimes polemically. The Syriac milieu in which al-Fārābī evolved is vital to our understanding of his philosophical formation and intentions, and it sheds much light on the form and content of his philosophical production. Through the Syriac translators and the living tradition of Syriac philosophising—as embodied in Mattā, who bridged the Syriac and Arabic trends—al-Fārābī had privileged access to the works of the Aristotelian commentators of late antiquity, which are constantly lurking in the background of his interpretation of Aristotle and shaped many of his more personal philosophical views. Moreover, the emphasis al-Fārābī put on the genre of the commentary is characteristic of his affiliation with this Syriac milieu, which had itself adopted this late antique practice. Yet, in spite of al-Fārābī’s close ties to the Syriac thinkers, his philosophical priorities and intellectual originality distinguished him from his peers; these scholars developed divergent interpretations of the philosophical issues they addressed. For example, a quick comparison of al-Fārābī’s and Yaḥyā Ibn ʿAdī’s works on the theme of unity, the <span><i>Risālat al-wāḥid wa-l-waḥda</i></span> (“Treatise on the one and oneness”) and <span><i>al-Maqāla fī l-tawḥīd</i></span> (“The treatise on divine oneness”) respectively, shows their profound differences in dealing with a similar theme.</p>
<p>Another key aspect of the intellectual milieu in which al-Fārābī flourished consists of the various Muslim philosophical and theological circles that existed in Baghdad in the early fourth/tenth century. Three individuals and groups should be mentioned here. Although difficult to assess, al-Fārābī’s knowledge of the philosophy and science produced by al-Kindī (d. c. 256/870) and the “Kindī circle” during the third/ninth century appears to have been limited, although it has been argued that the influence of al-Kindī and his school on al-Fārābī was greater than might be assumed at first (Janos, <span><i>Method</i></span>, 235–56, 266–9, 279–82). Also important is al-Fārābī’s possible reaction to the philosophical system of his older contemporary Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (d. 312/925), an original philosopher and brilliant physician who entertained pagan ideas and did not conform to Islamic dogma. Finally, the necessity for al-Fārābī to reckon with the theories of the Arabic theologians <span><i>(mutakallimūn)</i></span> also defined his intellectual and social milieu. This group split into various factions and schools and lacked cohesiveness, but, according to some studies, al-Fārābī was probably influenced by certain Muʿtazilī doctrines (Rudolph, Al-Fārābī und die Muʿtazila; Rudolph, Reflections), notably with regard to theology, as was the case earlier also with al-Kindī. On the basis of compelling formal parallels, Ulrich Rudolph has argued that the structure and contents of some of al-Fārābī’s works mirror Muʿtazilī theological treatises produced during the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries (Rudolph, Reflections). Finally, al-Fārābī may have written some works, such as <span><i>On the void</i></span> and a treatise addressed to Ibn al-Rāwandī (fl. 235/850), with the specific aim of refuting specific theological theses (Rudolph, Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī, 403).</p>
<p>In brief, we may situate al-Fārābī’s thought at the confluence of various intellectual currents, including late antique philosophy and science, the early Syriac and Arabic Christian philosophical traditions, and Arabic speculative theology <span><i>(kalām)</i></span>. The diversity of the scientific and religious traditions with which al-Fārābī came into contact in Baghdad accounts, to some extent, for his aim to establish a philosophical system and curriculum that would be based on demonstration <span><i>(burhān)</i></span> and certain knowledge <span><i>(ʿilm yaqīnī)</i></span> and that could therefore have universal appeal and transcend religious and ideological particularisms. At the same time, however, al-Fārābī intended his philosophy to be structured hierarchically on the basis of various epistemic criteria and hence to target different groups within society depending on their level of education. The cosmopolitan social and religious landscape of Baghdad at this time also accounts for his interest in clarifying the relation between philosophy and religion, concerning which he had a very pragmatic approach and which he articulated at length in his works (section 4, below). Finally, al-Fārābī’s exposure to the translation movement and to various languages, mostly Syriac and Arabic but also the various other idioms used in Baghdad, encouraged him to ponder the relation between language and philosophy, a theme for which he showed much sensibility and which he tackles repeatedly in his works. Al-Fārābī flourished when the movements for translation from Greek, Syriac, and Pahlavi into Arabic were still under way and when a specialised philosophical terminology in Arabic was slowly crystallising. As his <span><i>Kitāb al-Ḥurūf</i></span> (“Book of particles”) and his treatise <span><i>On the one</i></span> compellingly show, al-Fārābī was fully aware of the dependence of philosophical reflection on linguistic clarification, and he contributed significantly to this process in his own works (Zimmermann in al-Fārābī, <span><i>Al-Fārābī’s commentary</i></span>; Langhade; Lameer, <span><i>Al-Fārābī</i></span>; Shukri; Menn, Al-Fārābī’s <span><i>Kitāb al-ḥurūf</i></span>).</p>
<p>The various extant works ascribed to al-Fārābī present a wide diversity of genres, approaches, and style and defy easy categorisation. His corpus reflects some of the philosophical practices he inherited from late antiquity (especially his endorsement of the propaedeutic and commentary genres), and literary developments that shaped the early Arabic philosophical output (e.g., the genre of the short treatise, called <span><i>risāla</i></span> or <span><i>maqāla</i></span>). He also participated, to some extent, in the encyclopaedic tendencies of his time by composing various highly synthetic philosophical compendia covering a wide array of disciplines. His corpus, as it has come down to us, may be divided broadly into five parts: (a) the propaedeutic or methodological works providing instruction in the philosophical curriculum and its method, particularly points of logic; (b) commentaries, mostly on Aristotle; (c) short treatises on various specific and technical subjects; (d) philosophical compendia covering various topics in a systematic and integrated way; and (e), polemical works, mostly in defence of Aristotelian tenets. These writings testify to al-Fārābī’s intellectual diversity and his intention not only to transmit but also to reshape the philosophical tradition that he had inherited from the Greek and Syriac thinkers who preceded him.</p>",0
19,Abū Bakr al-Kalābādhī,أبو بكر الكلاباذي,al-Kalābādhī,الكلاباذي,380,"Chabbi, Jacqueline, “al-Kalābādhī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. ","<p>Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Isḥāq <span><b>al-Kalāabādhī</b></span> was the author of the <span><i>Kitāb al-taʿarruf li-madhhab ahl al-taṣawwuf</i></span> (“Book of acquaintance with the Ṣūfī school”), a famous treatise on Ṣūfism. His year of death is contested but was perhaps 380/990. He probably came from Kalābādh, a town near Bukhara, where his tomb is located. He is said to have been of the Ḥanafī rite, like many Transoxanians of his time. While it may be questioned whether he was the great jurist, the Indian author ʿAbd al-Ḥayy al-Lakhnawī (d. 1886) (Arberry, xi) made him out to be, he does seem to have been trained as a reporter of <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span> (prophetic Traditions), <span><i>āthār</i></span> (brief reports), and <span><i>akhbār</i></span> (news). This is attested by a selection of his traditions that has come down to us (<span><i>GAS</i></span>, 1:669).</p>
<p>Al-Kalābādhī is known primarily for his <span><i>Kitāb al-taʿarruf li-madhhab ahl al-taṣawwuf</i></span>. As with the <span><i>Kitāb al-lumaʿ</i></span> (“Book of flashes of light”) by the major Ṣūfī theorist and author from Khurāsān al-Sarrāj (d. 378/988), the precedence claimed for Ṣūfism is presented as going back to the era of the Prophets by emphasising the Ahl al-Ṣuffa (lit., the people of the platform, referring to a group of poor Muslims who, after the migration to Medina, were given permission by the Prophet to take up residence on a “platform” in the Medina Mosque; later generations of Muslims, especially the Ṣūfīs, venerated the pious and ascetic character of the Ahl al-Ṣuffā as a model for themselves). According to al-Kalābādhī (<span><i>bāb</i></span> 1, 22), the Qurʾānic verse 24:37 is supposed to refer to them. The next <span><i>bāb</i></span> (sub-chapter) provides a chronological catalogue of key figures in order to establish an uninterrupted chain of guarantors in the manner of the transmitters of <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>. In <span><i>bāb</i></span> 2, three representatives of the Ḥusaynid line, ʿAlī Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn (d. 94/712 or 95/713), his son Muḥammad al-Bāqir (d. 115/733), and his grandson Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (d. 148/765) are mentioned successively, after the generation of the Prophet’s Companions. They also appear in the <span><i>Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ</i></span> (“Adornment of the saints”) by Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī (d. 430/1039), a famous, widely travelled scholar and Ṣūfī author from Isfahan, but not in the <span><i>Kitāb al-lumaʿ</i></span>. The <span><i>Taʿarruf</i></span> goes on to present what we might consider a “profession of faith” <span><i>(ʿaqīda)</i></span> of Ṣūfism. It has been compared to the treatise <span><i>al-Fiqh al-akbar</i></span> II (“The greatest collection of jurisprudence II”), which, according to A. J. Wensinck (246), represents the Ḥanbalī current and should not be attributed to Abū Ḥanīfa (d. 150/767), the famous jurist and founder of the Ḥanafī school of Islamic jurisprudence. Al-Kalābādhī aimed to present Ṣūfism as a current to be included in the context of religious paths recognised alongside exoteric sciences. Al-Kalābādhī also asserts that no Ṣūfī, no matter what mystic state he may have achieved, can escape common practices. The reason is stated explicitly in the text of <span><i>Taʿarruf</i></span>—to evade the accusation of “antinomianism.” The theses are laid out in a special manner, distinguishing what the Ṣūfī masters agree on unanimously, <span><i>ijmāʿ</i></span>, from those points on which there is divergence, <span><i>ikhtilāf</i></span>. Al-Kalābādhī attempts to involve the Ṣūfīs in the theological argument of their time. His insistence on this legalistic approach is understood better in the context of the persecution following the execution (in Baghdad in 310/922) of al-Hallāj, the great mystic of Persian origin. Ṣūfism itself becomes a subject only in <span><i>bāb</i></span> 32 (out of a total of seventy-five). It is a thematic and systematic presentation in which the debate is pursued by Ṣūfī masters, sometimes with theologians <span><i>(mutakallimūn)</i></span> (<span><i>bāb</i></span> 26, on the <span><i>karāmāt al-awliyāʾ</i></span>, miracles of the saints). The masters of Iraqi Ṣūfism are the subject of many quotations—forty for the Baghdadi mystic of Persian origin al-Junayd (d. 297/910), twenty-five for another Baghdadi mystic of Persian origin Abū l-Husayn al-Nūrī (d. 295/907), and twenty-two for the Basran mystical exegete and theorist Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283/896). Louis Massignon (d. 1962), however, noted the direct relationship between al-Kalābādhī and the Ḥallājī tradition on the basis twenty-six quotations, including aphorisms and poems, from a mysterious figure presented as “one of the eminent men” <span><i>(baʿḍ al-kubarāʾ)</i></span>, who is none other than al-Ḥallāj himself. There are also passages included under the names of the notorious Ḥallājīs who had arrived in Iran, some of whom were originally from there. Abū Bakr al-Wāsiṭī, known as Ibn al-Farghānī (d. 320/932), and Fāris b. ʿĪsā al-Dinawārī (d. 345/956) have eight and sixteen quotations, respectively. On the other hand, Khurāsānī Ṣūfīs are seldom quoted, and some are even derided (Chabbi, 45–6). This explains the silence regarding the <span><i>Taʿarruf</i></span> and its author on the part of the authors of mystical literature in Khurāsān, such as the exegete, hagiographer, and theorist from Nīshāpūr al-Sulamī (d. 412/1021). Al-Kalābādhī was commented on (in a lost work) by al-Anṣārī al-Harawī (d. 481/1088), a teacher, exegete, and theorist from Herat, and Ismāʿīl al-Mustamlī (d. 434/1043), a compatriot and possible disciple of al-Kalābādhī, in his <span><i>Nūr al-murīdīn wa-faḍīḥat al-muddaʿīn</i></span> (“The light of the disciples and the disgraceful acts of the pretenders”, in Persian). The latter echoed the criticisms of al-Kalābādhī regarding “those who lay claims” to Ṣūfism. The <span><i>Taʿarruf</i></span> is taken up again much later in a commentary by Aḥmad b. Ismāʿīl al-Qunawī (d. 727/1326), a Shāfiʿī jurist, originally from Asia Minor, who taught in Damascus and in Cairo, where he operated an establishment for Ṣūfīs (<span><i>GAL</i></span>, 2:105).</p>

Al-Sulamī, who placed Abū Saʿīd at the head of the fifth generation (<span><i>ṭabaqa</i></span>) of Ṣūfī masters, mentioned “numerous works” which he allegedly wrote for his peers and disciples, none of which has come down to us. Abū Saʿīd's statements quoted by his biographers speak of ascetic flight from the world, humility, voluntary poverty, contentment with the divine decree (<span><i>al-riḍā</i></span>), and concentration on God in an effort to attain intimacy with him. In his words, “(Divine) gnosis (<span><i>al-maʿrifa</i></span>) is all about the acknowledgement of (one's) ignorance; Ṣūfism is all about the abandonment of that which is unnecessary; renunciation is all about the acceptance of the bare minimum and the rejection of everything else.” Asked when he felt content, he answered that he was content at all times because the times all belong to God, but the best of all times is when God endows him with the actions and thoughts that make God content with him. Such ideas were typical of the Baghdadi Ṣūfism of that age. Although Abū Saʿīd recounted dicta that are characteristic of both the “intoxicated” and the “sober” trends in Ṣūfism, as exemplified by al-Nūrī and al-Junayd respectively, he seems to have been more inclined to the sober. He may have owed this inclination to his teacher ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī, who exemplified “a stern, sober, and ascetic” type of Ṣūfī piety (Knysh, 122).</p>",1

Little is known about his life and education. In the historical sources only Ibn al-Khammār, the renowned Christian physician and philosopher, is mentioned as his master (Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, 1/240), but it appears that he was mostly engaged in studying the traditional sciences, particularly philosophy, in the monasteries and Nestorian schools of Iraq. Abū al-Faraj worked for many years at the ʿAḍudī hospital in Baghdad, teaching medicine and treating patients, and he trained many students, some of whom, such as Ibn Buṭlān and Ibn Athradī, became the pre-eminent scholars of their age. His reputation grew to such an extent that people flocked to Baghdad from far afield, eager to learn from him (al-Qifṭī, 223; Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, 1/239–240).</p> <p>Abū al-Faraj was a very devout Christian (see Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, 1/239–240), highly esteemed by senior Nestorian clerics. He was secretary to Yuḥannā b. Nāzūk, the patriarch of Madāʾin, and then secretary to Elias I, the Catholicos of Baghdad (Ibn Mattā, 96, 98). When he died in 435/1044, he was buried in the Durtā monastery near Baghdad.</p> <p>Abū al-Faraj was known as an outstanding scholar of philosophy and medicine, who revived the sciences of the classical Graeco-Roman heritage which had fallen into neglect. According to Ibn Buṭlān, his pupil, he spent twenty years studying and commenting on Aristotle's <span><i>Metaphysics</i></span> (al-Qifṭī, 223). In spite of this, according to Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa (1/239), the great Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna), a contemporary of Abū al-Faraj, although praising him for his skill in medicine was critical of his philosophical writings. In addition, as al-Bayhaqī reports (p. 28), after praising Abū al-Faraj'sknowledge of medicine, Ibn Sīnā later came to the conclusion that some of his treatises in this field were also inadequate. However, Ibn Sīnā's view may, according to al-Bayhaqī, actually have arisen out of a bitter rivalry between peers (al-Bayhaqī, p. 28).</p> <p>Most of Abū al-Faraj's works, which consist of commentaries on philosophical, logical and medical works by Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen, are of crucial importance because of his knowledge of both Greek and Latin as well as Syriac and Arabic. Apparently, in order to get across difficult points to his students, he used to go into great detail when explaining a particular subject; and criticism of such methods, which he had to endure from some quarters (al-Qifṭī, 223), may have led him to condense many of his books and their commentaries later on. Some of his treatises are known under more than one title, and in most recent sources they have been treated as independent works.</p>",1
22,Abū Zakariyā Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī,أبو زكريا يحيى بن عدي,Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī,ابن عدي,363,"Platti, Emilio, “Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī”, in: Christian-Muslim Relations 600 - 1500, General Editor David Thomas. ","<p>Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī is one of the most outstanding Christian Arab thinkers of the 10<span><sup>th</sup></span> century. He was a Jacobite theologian and a philosopher, born in the then Christian town of Takrīt in 893 or 894. He spent his active life in Baghdad, where he died on 13 August 974 at the age of 81, and was buried at the Church of St Thomas, in the area called al-Qaṭīʿa, in north-western Baghdad. He earned his living as a copyist, but became famous as master of the Baghdad School of philosophers, the so-called School of ‘the Baghdad Peripatetics’, whose last representative in Baghdad was Abū l-Faraj ʿAbdallāh Ibn al-Ṭayyib (d. 1044) (q.v.), a contemporary of Avicenna (d. 1037). Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī was himself a disciple of the Nestorian philosopher, Abū Bishr Mattā (d. 940), and his disciple, Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī (d. 950).</p><p>He was a renowned translator or re-translator of parts of Aristotle’s <span><i>Organon</i></span>, other works of Aristotle and ancient commentators (Badawi, <span><i>Manṭiq</i></span> and <span><i>Rasāʾil</i></span>). He wrote several treatises and short commentaries concerning logic, physics, metaphysics, and ethics. From al-Qifṭī’s <span><i>Tārīkh</i></span>, we know that his brother, Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAdī al-Kātib, was closely associated with al-Fārābī. Some of Yaḥyā’s disciples themselves became outstanding commentators, logicians, and philosophers, such as ʿĪsā ibn Zurʿa (also a Jacobite; d. 1008), al-Ḥasan ibn Suwār (d. 1017), Abū Sulaymān al-Sijistānī (d. after 1001) (q.v.), and others mentioned by Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (d. 1023) in his detailed account of Yaḥyā’s numerous <span><i>majālis</i></span>, sessions with disciples and other intellectuals. Not only from these discussions attended by individuals from various denominations, but also from treatises and correspondence, we learn about the positive interaction that existed between intellectuals related in one way or another to the School of Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī, and which was based on their common knowledge of ancient logic and philosophy.</p><p>Following on from his master Abū Bishr, whose discussion with the grammarian al-Sīrāfī on the merits of logic and grammar became famous, Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī defended the rules of demonstration established by Aristotle as the universal foundation of knowledge. For him, as for Abū Bishr,&nbsp;what is correct can only be established through the art of logic, and not through the art of grammar, because only logical demonstration can distinguish between true statements and false ones. In his treatise on the difference between the arts of philosophical logic and of Arabic grammar, he defended the superior claim of logic, maintaining that ‘grammar is neither concerned with the meaning (<span><i>al-maʿnā</i></span>, the thing signified), nor with significant utterances as such …. Significant utterances are the subject of logic – only those, however, which denote the <span><i>universalia</i></span>, because only these are constituent parts of logical demonstration; valid demonstration requires the combination of utterances in accordance with the actual reality signified through them’ (Endress<span><i>, The debate</i></span>, p. 321). We cannot underestimate this basic position on demonstration, as Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī applied the tools of demonstrative logic in defending his miaphysite Christian creed, as well as in discussing various topics of religious philosophy.</p><p>Two texts on ethical subjects are attributed to Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī. The first is a collection on sexual abstinence, only extant in MS Cairo, Coptic Patriarchate – Theol. 83 (Mistrih, <span><i>Continence</i></span>, p. 3); some texts are in response to ‘a friend’, who is unknown but who could be Muslim. The second is part of the common Arabic literary legacy, which has also been attributed to Ibn al-ʿArabī, al-Jāḥiẓ, and Ibn al-Haytham, and has been edited many times, as early as 1871 and recently, in 2002, by S.H. Griffith under the title <span><i>The reformation of morals</i></span> (<span><i>Tahdhīb al-akhlāq</i></span>). Manuscripts, editions, and questions of attribution are presented in detail, with a reprint of Samir’s edition (Cairo, 1994), by ʿĀṭif Khalīl al-Ḥakīm (<span><i>Al-ḥikma al-ʿamaliyya</i></span>, 2006). While al-Ḥakīm has doubts, most modern scholars agree with Endress’ conclusion, quoted by Griffith, ‘that there is no intrinsic evidence against the authorship of Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī’; thus, recent editions (Samir, Urvoy, Naj al-Takrītī, Hatem, etc.) attribute this work to Yaḥyā. According to Griffith, this treatise on the improvement of morals represents ‘a high degree of cultural integration on the part of a Christian writer in the Islamic milieu’; and it may ‘be seen as a Christian contribution to the burgeoning Arabic/Islamic intellectual culture of the early Abbasid period’ (Griffith, <span><i>Reformation</i></span>, p. xxix).</p><p>Most significant in the field of Christian-Muslim relations are, on the one hand, Yaḥyā’s refutations in defense of the Christian concepts of Incarnation and Trinity and, on the other, his treatises on topics of religious philosophy directly linked to important concepts of Islamic theology, such as the unity of God (<span><i>tawḥīd</i></span>), the status of the human act and ‘acquisition’ (<span><i>kisb</i></span> or <span><i>iktisāb</i></span>), the nature of the possible (<span><i>ṭabīʿat al-mumkin</i></span>), and divine foreknowledge. These two fields are to be properly distinguished, as is clearly formulated by Griffith: ‘On one level it is certainly true that a clash of theologies characterized the relationship between Muslims and Christians in the early Islamic period, in the sense that their shared reasoning issued in radically opposed conclusions on major religious topics. But on another level it is also true that the dialogue between them, which the public culture they shared made possible, allowed them to discuss together such issues as the ontological status of the divine attributes, or the effects of the acts of the divine will on human freedom’ (Griffith, <span><i>The church</i></span><span><i>in the shadow of the mosque</i></span>, p. 158).</p><p>The positive interaction between Muslim correspondents and Yaḥyā is not only apparent in the treatises concerning subjects of Islamic <span><i>kalām</i></span> or Christian theology, but also in other works in which Muslim correspondents are referred to. In the case of Yaḥyā’s responses to 14 questions on logic, physics, metaphysics, and medicine, it is mentioned that the questions were submitted by renowned Jewish correspondents: Bishr ibn Simsān al-Yahūdī transmitted these questions on behalf of Ibn Abī Saʿīd ʿIrs ibn ʿUthmān al-Yahūdī l-Mawṣilī, member of the Jewish family of the Banū ʿUmrān, while Yaḥyā expresses his highest esteem for ‘his friend and brother’ (<span><i>ṣadīqunā wa-akhūnā</i></span>) Abū Isḥāq ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Bakkūs, a well-known physician. It appears from these questions and also from al-Tawḥīdī’s reports that Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī was involved in discussions concerning not only theology and religious philosophy, but also other sciences linked to physics, chemistry, or mathematics.</p><p>In the whole of Yaḥyā ibn ʿAdī’s work, there are some strictly confessional treatises on questions of theology, Christian worship, and biblical exegesis (as clearly mentioned in Endress, <span><i>Inventory</i></span>). It is sometimes quite difficult to distinguish between apologetic treatises concerning internal discussions between Christian denominations and polemical work involving anonymous Muslim correspondents. The criterion for distinguishing between them is simply the relevance of the text to questions raised by Muslims throughout history, mostly concerning the Trinity, the Incarnation, and redemption.</p>",1

(Timm, <span><i>Das christlich-koptische Ägypten</i></span>, has located a place called Bashū near Kafr al-Shaykh in the Nile Delta.) As an adult, Simʿān was a skilled financial administrator (<span><i>kātib</i></span>) who in 1173/4 came to be employed in the Bureau of the Army under Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn al-Ayyūbī (1271-93); there he served ably and was rewarded generously. Sometime during the reign of Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn’s younger brother al-ʿĀdil (1200-18), however, Simʿān retired to the Monastery of St John the Short in the Wādī l-Naṭrūn, where he built a cell in which he became a recluse (<span><i>ḥabīs</i></span>). He spent more than 30 years as a monk, and his literary activity undoubtedly dates to this time.</p> <p>A defective reading in Erpenius’ edition of al-Makīn’s <span><i>History</i></span> has led to some confusion in the literature regarding the dates of Simʿān’s withdrawal from the world and of his death: one often sees the claim that Simʿān was appointed to the Army Bureau in 1173, withdrew to become a monk – here is the problematic text – <span><i>three years later</i></span> (thus in 1176), and died sometime after 1206. However, Samir (‘Le “Livre des moeurs bienheureuses”’, pp. 154-56) called the date of Simʿān’s death into question; Wadi (‘Al-Makīn’, pp. 18-19) provided a clearer text of the relevant passage in al-Makīn’s <span><i>History</i></span>; and Sidarus (‘La pré-renaissance copte arabe’, p.&nbsp;202) summarized the results: Simʿān had a long career in government service, became a monk after the year 1200, and probably died at an advanced age toward the year 1240. This result was anticipated long ago by Evelyn White, according to whom a note in MS Paris, BNF Ar. 43 should be read to say that Simʿān became a monk in 1206/7, and that, <span><i>if</i></span> this were true, ‘his death occurred somewhat later than 1237’ (Evelyn White, <span><i>Monasteries</i></span> ii, p. 387).</p> <p>In addition to the two works described below, we also have from Simʿān’s hand a commentary on the Gospel of Matthew and an introduction to the Psalter (Graf, <span><i>GCAL</i></span> ii, pp. 337-38), neither of which has yet been edited.

He became the East-Syrian (‘Nestorian’) bishop of Mardin under the name of Joseph, but was later, at an unknown date, transferred to the more prestigious metropolitan see of Nisibis, to which the territory of the former diocese of Greater Armenia had been annexed. He then adopted the name Ishoʿyahb. As metropolitan of Nisibis, he participated in the elective Synod of Catholicos Sabrishoʿ IV bar Qayyumā in 1222 (see Gismondi, <span><i>Patriarchal history</i></span>).</p><p>Ishoʿyahb was an important author who wrote in both Syriac and Arabic. According to his successor, ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikhā (q.v.), he wrote a number of poetical compositions in Syriac (<span><i>ʿonyātā</i></span> and <span><i>madrāshē</i></span>), but the majority of his writings were in Arabic, which was the language he favored for the discussion of theological problems. He wrote a profession of faith which, after his death, was sent to the pope as proof of the ‘orthodoxy’ of the East-Syrian Christians. This creed is preserved in Arabic and in a Latin translation.</p><p>Bar Malkon was very much interested in Syro-Arabic linguistic and philological issues, as appears from both his Syriac-Arabic dictionary of ambiguous words and, more especially, his grammar of the Syriac language, which followed the system and methods used by Arabic grammarians (Scher, <span><i>Catalogue</i></span>, pp. 72-73). In imitation of Muslim preachers, he used rhymed prose (<span><i>sajʿ</i></span>) in some of his homilies, more particularly those on the Gospel readings of the liturgical year, which he himself had translated into Arabic.</p><p>Because of his openness to the cultural and scientific Islamic world, he seems a typical representative of the period that has been characterized as a ‘Syriac Renaissance’ (Teule, ‘Syriac Renaissance’). This is confirmed by the epitaph on his recently discovered tomb, which mentions that he contributed to two traditions, Syriac and Arabic.</p><p>An interesting example of the manner in which he integrated Muslim philosophy into his Christian theological thinking is found in his <span><i>Risālat al-bayān</i></span>.

He served as metropolitan archbishop of Nisibis (present-day Nusaybin, Turkey) for the East Syriac (“Nestorian”) Church of the East from 399/1008 to 438/1046. He was born in Shīnāyā (hence his nickname Bar Shīnāyā), near the Tigris, south of the Great Zab River. He was ordained a priest in 384/994 by Yuḥannā b. ʿĪsā (d. 401–2/1011), a bishop who would later become patriarch of the Church of the East, and he was made an arch-priest at the Monastery of Saint Simeon, which was near Shīnāya, and served at the Monastery of Saint Michael, near Mosul, from 386/996 to 390/1000. In 392/1002, he was made bishop of Bēt Nūhadrā, a diocese extending from the Khābūr River to the Tigris, in northern Mesopotamia. In 399/1008, he was consecrated metropolitan archbishop of Nisibis.</p><p>Little else is known of Elias’s life. He wrote a public letter to the Christians of Baghdad denouncing the election of the patriarch Ishoʿyahb IV (r. 1021–5 C.E.) on account of the allegations that the patriarch had bribed Muslim leaders to secure his nomination. He also had difficulties with Ishoʿyahb’s successor as patriarch, Elias I (r. 1028–49), although they met and were reconciled. Elias of Nisibis died in 438/1046 and was buried in Mayyāfāriqīn (present-day Silvan, in southeastern Turkey) next to his brother, Abū Saʿīd Manṣūr b. ʿĪsā, known as Zāhid al-ʿUlamāʾ (d. before 438/1046). His brother, who wrote several works on medicine, was a well known physician to the Kurdish Marwānid <span><i>amīr</i></span> Naṣr al-Dawla Aḥmad b. Marwān (r. 401–53/1011–61).</p><p>Elias wrote prodigiously in Arabic and Syriac. He was known by his contemporaries as a theologian, historian, philosopher, physician, scientist, linguist, and grammarian. He was involved in public affairs as a representative of his Christian community and maintained private correspondences with Muslim dignitaries such as the local <span><i>wazīr</i></span> Abū l-Qāsim al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī al-Maghribī (d. 418/1027) and the Marwānid <span><i>amīr</i></span> Naṣr al-Dawla, his own brother Manṣūr, the Syriac Christian physician Ibn Buṭlān of Baghdad (d. c. 458/1066), his fellow bishops, and patriarchal officials. Elias composed nearly two dozen works that are known.</p><p>Among Elias’s most important works is his <span><i>Kitāb al-azmina</i></span> (“Chronicle”), the only composition of its style among East Syriac Christians. It is exceptional also in that Elias cites his sources. The work was written in parallel columns, one in Syriac, the other in Arabic. The first part includes an historical section, and the second contains calendars, tables for calculating dates, conversion charts, and other useful information. Elias cites several Muslim authorities, including the historian al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923), the mathematician Muḥammad b. Mūsā l-Khwārazmī (d. c. 233/847–8), the Baghdad littérateur Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Yaḥyā al-Ṣūlī (d. 335/946–7), and the chronicler Thābit b. Sinān (d. 363/974).</p><p>The <span><i>Kitāb al-majālis</i></span> (“Book of sessions”) is a collection of seven discussions that Elias held with the local <span><i>wazīr</i></span> Abū l-Qāsim al-Maghribī in 417/1026 and 418/1027. The text was disseminated widely among Arab Christians in the mediaeval period. Al-Maghribī belonged to a family of influential administrators in Fāṭimid Cairo, but then fled from the caliph al-Ḥākim (r. 386–411/996–1021) to the protection of the Marwānid <span><i>amīr</i></span> Naṣr al-Dawla in eastern Anatolia. Al-Maghribī was known also for his literary output, including a letter on proper political rule and <span><i>al-Maṣābīḥ fī tafsīr al-Qurʾān</i></span>, a commentary on the Qurʾān.</p><p>The first session describes the circumstances of their meeting. Al-Maghribī tells Elias that he was deathly ill recently but was miraculously nursed back to health at a monastery, as a result of which he came to believe that Christians are monotheists. Elias explains that the Christian understanding of God is indeed monotheistic, as is clear from a proper understanding of their use of the terms “substance” <span><i>(jawhar)</i></span> and “hypostases” (<span><i>aqānīm</i></span>, sing. <span><i>uqnūm</i></span>, the three elements of the Trinity). The second conversation is on the Incarnation and the hypostatic union in relation to the unicity of God <span><i>(tawḥīd).</i></span> Elias explains how Jesus is favoured over the prophets and why the Church of the East disagrees with the Melkites (Arab Byzantine Orthodox) and the Jacobites (West Syrian Miaphysites) about Christology. In the third session, Elias and the <span><i>wazīr</i></span> discuss Christian monotheism according to the Qurʾān. Elias claims that Christians are monotheists according to the Qurʾān and Muslim commentators, citing al-Ṭabarī and al-Bāqillānī (d. 403/1013) and alluding to the <span><i>wazīr’</i></span>s own commentary in his examples. They also discuss the possibility that Christians may be saved according to their status in the Qurʾān and Islamic tradition. The fourth discussion addresses Elias’s claim that Christianity is confirmable through reason and miracles; Elias insists that his faith is based on evidence rather than indoctrination.</p><p>The fifth conversation is a brief summary of Elias’s confession of monotheistic faith. His words persuade al-Maghribī that Christianity is rational. Al-Maghribī notes that only the prophethood of Muḥammad makes him question the legitimacy of Christianity. In the sixth session, Elias asserts the superiority of the Syriac language over Arabic, based on syntax, lexicography, and script. Elias was an expert on this topic, having written a Syriac grammar and a Syriac-Arabic dictionary. The seventh meeting concerns astrology and free will and Elias’s view that Christians prefer Muslims over other religious groups because Muslims respect Christianity, they recognise that Christ is the Word of God and is living in heaven, and they enforce laws to protect Christians. Elias also explains the reciprocal obligations between the two communities—for instance, that Muslims should honour and respect Christian leaders and should not judge between Christians but leave matters to the ecclesiastical courts. At the conclusion of the work, the <span><i>wazīr</i></span> asks for the monks in the region to pray for his health. Elias responds that the monks do not pray for long lives but only that God should make one capable of accepting His will. Al-Maghribī died several months after their final dialogue.</p><p>While the <span><i>Kitāb al-majālis</i></span> is the principal record of discussions between Elias of Nisibis and al-Maghribī, evidence suggests they also maintained an extensive correspondence, although only three <span><i>Risālāt ilā l-wazīr al-kāmil Abī l-Qāsim al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī</i></span> (“Letters to the eminent <span><i>wazīr</i></span> Abū Qāsim al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī”) have been preserved. The first letter is from the <span><i>wazīr</i></span>, asking for a summary of their recent discussions, the second contains Elias’s description of the events and topics, and the third is al-Maghribī’s reply, to the effect that Elias wrote in a faithful manner, with commendable style.</p><p>Elias wrote several important apologetic works for a Muslim audience, including a <span><i>Risāla fī waḥdāniyyat al-khāliq wa-tathlīth aqānīmihi</i></span> (“Letter on the unity of the Creator and his triune hypostases”) to an anonymous Muslim judge in Mosul in 420/1029, answering the judge’s request for expert testimony on the Christian conception of God in three hypostases and Muslim claims of Christian polytheism. Elias’s <span><i>Kitāb al-burhān ʿalā ṣaḥīḥ al-īmān</i></span> (“Demonstration on the true faith”) is a comprehensive explanation of the doctrine of the Church of the East, but it includes an opening chapter on Muslims, in which he argues that the Christian conception of the Trinity does not compromise its monotheism. In Elias’s <span><i>Risāla fī l-khāliq</i></span> (“Letter on the Creator”), he explains how God can be described with the single term “substance” <span><i>(jawhar)</i></span> while being three hypostases (Logos, Word, and Life-giving Spirit), in response to the Muslim objection that Christians associate God with two other eternals.

He studied literature, physics, mathematics and then philosophy under the direction of Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī [<span><i>q.v.</i></span>]; he seems also to have studied medicine, since Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa includes him among the famous physicians. Nevertheless he was forced to earn his living by engaging in commercial activities and trading in particular with Byzantium, which, in the opinion of Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, hindered greatly his philosophical work. Furthermore, his competitors denounced him to the authorities, accusing him of secret intrigues with Byzantium, so that he was arrested and sentenced, and his possessions were confiscated. These disasters ruined his already poor health and hastened his death.</p> <p>Ibn Zurʿa translated or abridged, probably from the Syriac, several works of Aristotle and in particular the  <span><i>Historia Animalium</i></span> ; he is, because of this, esteemed as a translator. However, his fame is based on a number of treatises on philosophy, theology and of apologetics, which are mostly lost. Of the list of his works given by Ibn al-Nadīm and completed by al-Ḳiftī and Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, it appears that there has survived only one translation (the Sophistical Refutations of Aristotle,  <span><i>Sūfisṭīḳā</i></span> , ms. Paris, ar. 2346; see ʿA. Badawī,  <span><i>Manṭiḳ Arisṭū</i></span> , iii, 737-1016), and ten or so treatises. Four of these have been published by P. Sbath ( <span><i>Vingt traités philosophiques et apologétiques d’auteurs arabes chrétiens du IX</i></span> <span><sup>e</sup></span> <span><i>au XIV</i></span> <span><sup>e</sup></span>  <span><i>siècle</i></span> , Cairo 1929); a treatise on the intellect (68-75); a letter to a Muslim friend on the existence of God (6-19); a refutation of the  <span><i>Awāʾil al-adilla fī uṣūl al-dīn</i></span> of Abu ’l-Ḳāsim ʿAbd Allāh b.

It should be stated that the attribution of these works to Ibn Zurʿa is not absolutely certain; at least two other texts have been falsely attributed to him: the    <span><i>Maḳāla fī māhiyyat ittiḥād al-Naṣārā</i></span> of Abū ʿAlī Naṣīf b.

This study shows that Ibn Zurʿa follows in general his teacher, Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī, but departs from him on points of detail, makes great use of Aristotelian logic, of Platonic or Plotinan doctrine, of the Bible and of the Fathers of the Church, in order to present, in a fairly heavy style, a cool but scholarly and rational apologetic, which only rarely has recourse to <span><i>argumentum ad hominem</i></span>.",1
27,Ibn al-ʿAssāl,ابن العسال,Ibn al-ʿAssāl,ابن العسال,-,"Atiya, A.S., “Ibn al-ʿAssāl”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.","Ibn al-ʿAssāl Coptic family which came originally from the village of Sadamant in the Province of Beni Suef in Middle Egypt at an unknown date and settled in Cairo, where its members rose to wealth and high station at the Ayyūbid court during the 7th/13th century. They owned a residence in the capital and occupied a position of leadership in their own community. Though their history is obscure, they were reckoned among the most learned Copts in mediaeval times.</p> <p>Early modern historians of Egypt appear to have vaguely recognized in Ibn al-ʿAssāl only a single personality in mediaeval Christian Arabic literature, until in 1713 Renaudot (pp. 585-86, work cited below) revealed that two different brothers had written independently under that name. Afterwards, while classifying some of their manuscripts in the British Museum in 1894, Rieu (p. 18) was able to establish the fact that they were three brothers instead of two. Then in 1905, from different sources (especially the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris), Mallon (<span><i>JA</i></span>, 1905, 509-29) confirmed Rieu’s thesis and proved that the three attained great literary eminence under the collective name of Awlād al-ʿAssāl, <span><i>i.e.</i></span>, the sons of the honey producer or merchant, presumably the title and vocation of the founder of that family. Coptic historians, however, including Yaʿḳūb Nak̲h̲la Rufayla (p. 185) and the Commission of Coptic History (Lad̲j̲nat al-Taʾrīk̲h̲ al-Ḳibṭī, 148-52) increased the number of “Awlād al-ʿAssāl” by two more—the father and a fourth brother—who also were high dignitaries in the Ayyūbid bureaucracy, though rich literary remains were left only by the other three. In 1943, Higgins (see ref. below) has laboured to establish a new thesis that two sets of Awlād al-ʿAssāl had lived—one at the beginning of the 5th/11th century and another in the 7th/13th century. Since this argument is based on a dubious date (500/1107) in the colophon of a single British Museum manuscript (Arab. e 163, f. 288 r.), we must for the present maintain that the 7th/13th century group is the only one convincingly established.</p> <p>The full names of the Awlād al-ʿAssāl are as follows: (a) Abu’l-Faḍl b. Abī Isḥāḳ Ibrāhīm b. Abī Sahl Ḏj̲ird̲j̲is b. Abī al-Yusr Yūḥannā b. al-ʿAssāl, the father, known as <span><i>al-kātib al-Miṣrī</i></span> , “the Egyptian scribe” or “secretary”, who bore the title Fak̲h̲r al-Dawla; (b) al-Ṣafī Abu’l-Faḍāʾil b. al-ʿAssāl, with the title Ṣafī al-Dawla; (c) al-Asʿad Abu’l-Farad̲j̲ Hibat-Allāh b. al-ʿAssāl; (d) al-Muʾtaman Abū Isḥāḳ Ibrāhīm b. al-ʿAssāl, with the title Muʾtaman al-Dawla; (e) al-Amd̲j̲ad Abu’l-Mad̲j̲d b. al-ʿAssāl, who was Secretary of the important <span><i>Dīwān</i></span> of the Army. The last two were step-brothers of the preceding two, who are described as full brothers.</p> <p>The literary figures in the list were al-Ṣafī, al-Asʿad and al-Muʾtaman. In spite of their apparent importance, our knowledge of their lives will remain meagre until further data are gleaned from their numerous works, the chief source for any study on the Awlād al-ʿAssāl. All had lived approximately in the tumultuous first half of the 7th/13th century, when Egypt resisted successive crusading attacks on its shores, culminating in the fall of Damietta (1248) and the ultimate discomfiture and imprisonment of King Louis IX of France at the famous battle of Manṣūra in 1350. The firm position of the Awlād al-ʿAssāl in the Ayyūbid administration during those years reveals the loyalty of the Copts to the reigning dynasty and their hostility to the Crusade — a movement which aimed at their humiliation as being schismatics, and thus worse than heretics.</p> <p>Both al-Ṣafī and al-Asʿad are known from a citation by their third step-brother to have died before 658/1260. The major works of the three are believed to have been accomplished approximately in the decade 627-37/1230-40. All were men of great learning in both the humanities and science. All were masters of Arabic style and in addition well acquainted with Coptic, Greek and Syriac.</p> <p>Until Ayyūbid times, Coptic was still in use as a language throughout Egypt, though it was increasingly felt that Arabic was becoming a serious menace to its survival. Hence arose a new class of scholars who concentrated on writing Coptic grammars in Arabic and compiled Copto-Arabic dictionaries to ensure the preservation of their ancestral tongue. The Awlād al-ʿAssāl distinguished themselves in this school, as may be witnessed from the enumeration of their works below. In addition to their excellence in Coptic philology, they made outstanding contributions to Coptic canon law, theology, philosophy, Christian polemics, homiletics, Biblical studies, exegesis and all manner of enquiry into their own religion.</p> <p>The church must have meant a great deal to them, since, as archons or lay leaders of the community, they carried high the torch of reform at a moment when the Patriarchate itself fell into the hands of the ungodly. The infamous Cyril ibn Luḳluḳ (1235-43) occupied the throne of St. Mark by treachery and flourished on simony, while buying royal support by bribery. Finally in 1239 the prelates of the Church forced Cyril to convene a Synod, probably at the Muʿallaḳa Church in Old Cairo, which reviewed all ecclesiastical evils and prescribed total reform. It is noteworthy that al-Ṣafī was the secretary of that Synod and its moving spirit. The Bishops commissioned him to compile what became the greatest and most enduring digest of Coptic canon law and tradition from all the ancient sources available. This tome was named after him <span><i>al-Mad̲j̲mūʿ al-Ṣafawī</i></span> , which remains an authority to this day.</p> <p>The Awlād al-ʿAssāl’s monumental contributions may be appraised from the number and nature of their manuscripts. The Coptic Museum alone has forty-nine, besides many more that are found in European collections, including the Vatican, Florence, the Bodleian, the British Museum, the Bibliothèque Nationale and numerous others, public and private, the most elaborate survey of which we owe to the indefatigable diligence of the late Mgr. Georg Graf<p>Besides numerous religious and philological works, they also wrote some Arabic poetry of no mean quality, notably the  <span><i>urdjūza</i></span> type for homiletics and the formulation of legal rules of inheritance. It may, however, be deduced from the above that al-Ṣafī was the canonist and philosopher, al-Asʿad the exegete and grammarian, and al-Muʾtaman the theologian and philologist. Their legacy appears to be the consummation of the Coptic culture in the Islamic Middle Ages, though our comprehension of the depth and breadth of their endeavour is still in its infancy.</p>",1

","<p>The 11<span><sup>th</sup></span>-century Arab Orthodox (Melkite) translator and theologian ʿAbdallāh ibn al-Faḍl al-Anṭākī is one of the most prolific contributors to the (unfortunately hitherto insufficiently studied) Antiochene Graeco-Arabic translation movement of Christian works, especially of Greek patristic authors. Little is known for certain about his life. From his full name as given in manuscripts – <span><i>al-shammās ʿAbdallāh ibn al-Faḍl ibn ʿAbdallāh al-muṭrān al-Anṭākī</i></span> – it can be deduced that he was a deacon (<span><i>shammās</i></span>) in the church of Antioch and a grandson of a metropolitan bishop, whose name was also ʿAbdallāh.</p> <p>Marginal notes in his <span><i>Garden</i></span> (<span><i>Kitāb al-rawḍa</i></span>) refer to his teachers in Greek and Arabic literature: Simʿān al-ʾymsyqn (?) ibn al-Sabnakhī (?) and a certain Abū l-ʿAlāʾ respectively. The former name has so far defied interpretation. The latter can be identified, with a high degree of certainty, with the famous blind poet Abū l-ʿAlāʾ al-Maʿarrī (973-1057) (q.v.), who, according to Ibn al-Qifṭī and others, visited Antioch in his youth. If Ibn al-Faḍl had studied with al-Maʿarrī on that occasion, this would push his year of birth well back into the 10<span><sup>th</sup></span> century, meaning that he remained active until a very old age. It is perhaps more likely that Ibn al-Faḍl paid a visit to Maʿarrat al-Nuʿmān (or Baghdad) at a later date and met the celebrity poet there. With al-Maʿarrī, Ibn al-Faḍl studied Arabic grammar and lexicography, specifically Ibn al-Sikkīt’s manual <span><i>Iṣlāḥ al-manṭiq</i></span>.</p> <p>It is possible that Ibn al-Faḍl visited Baghdad. At the very least, it seems certain that he had close ties to the Baghdad philosophical circles. His warm comment, in ch. 65 of <span><i>Benefit</i></span>, on the Nestorian philosopher and theologian Abū l-Faraj ibn al-Ṭayyib (d. 1043 in Baghdad), after the latter’s death, makes one suspect that Ibn al-Faḍl might have known him in person. (It is perhaps significant that, according to the Muslim historian Ibn al-ʿAdīm, Ibn al-Ṭayyib himself was a native of Antioch.)</p> <p>We also know of Ibn al-Faḍl’s contacts with Christian intellectuals and church officials, who, in several cases, commissioned from him translations and theological works. Thus, Ibn al-Faḍl’s <span><i>Exposition of the Orthodox faith</i></span> (<span><i>Sharḥ al-amāna al-mustaqīma</i></span>) was commissioned by John, bishop of Manbij (Hierapolis or Mabbug in northern Syria), the translation of the Psalms by a certain Abū Zakariyyā ibn Salāma (though MS New Haven, Beinecke Library – 349, fol. 181v gives two names: Zakhariyyā and Yūḥannā ibn Salāma), and the translation of Isaac of Nineveh (made from an earlier Greek version produced at Mar Saba in the 9<span><sup>th</sup></span> century) by a certain Nikephoros (Nīkūfūr) Abū l-Naṣr ibn Buṭrus al-Qubuqlīs (i.e. the <span><i>kouboukleisios</i></span>, or chamberlain of the patriarch of Antioch). Unfortunately, nothing can be ascertained about these individuals.</p> <p>Seventeenth and 18<span><sup>th</sup></span>-century Arab Orthodox authors, such as the patriarch of Antioch, Makarios III ibn al-Zaʿīm (patriarch 1647-72) and the historian Mikhail Breik (d. 1782), as well as numerous manuscripts from that period, treat Ibn al-Faḍl as a Christian saint, for his outstanding contribution to the life of the Church as translator and theologian.</p> </div>",1

Swanson, Mark, “Dāniyāl al-Suryānī l-Mārdīnī; (= Daniel ibn al-Khaṭṭāb?)”, in: Christian-Muslim Relations 600 - 1500, General Editor David Thomas.","<p>The author of the <span><i>Kitāb uṣūl al-dīn</i></span> (‘The fundamentals of religion’) described below was a West-Syrian (‘Jacobite’) monk who, in the MSS of the work, is regularly identified as Dāniyāl (Daniel) ibn al-Khaṭṭāb. Early 20<span><sup>th</sup></span>-century scholarship identified two possibilities for saying more about this author. First, F. Nau discovered and in 1905 published the story of <span><i>rabban</i></span> Daniel of Mardin, a scholarly monk who in 1382 was arrested and tortured by the Muslim authorities in Mardin because of the controversial character of a book he wrote on ‘ecclesiastical fundamentals’. In 1920, A. Baumstark identified Daniel ibn al-Khaṭṭāb as a younger contemporary of Barhebraeus (1226-86; q.v.) who was known for a poetical controversy with the East-Syrian Khamīs ibn Qardāḥē. Since then, opinions have varied as to whether <span><i>rabban</i></span> Daniel of Mardin and Daniel ibn al-Khaṭṭāb are to be identified with one another or not. Graf (<span><i>GCAL</i></span> ii, p. 281) opted for a single author who suffered in Mardin in 1382; Barṣawm (<span><i>Al-luʾluʾ</i></span>, p. 442) attributed the <span><i>Kitāb uṣūl al-dīn</i></span> and translations of Barhebraeus to the 14<span><sup>th</sup></span>-century Daniel of Mardin, while distinguishing him from a 13<span><sup>th</sup></span>-century Daniel ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, the correspondent of Khamīs ibn Qardāḥē. Barṣawm’s position required him to hold that the ascription of the <span><i>Kitāb uṣūl al-dīn</i></span> to Daniel ‘ibn al-Khaṭṭāb’ in some manuscripts was due to confusion in the scribal tradition.</p> <p>Graf and Barṣawm both relied on a manuscript note by one Dāʾūd al-Ḥimṣī preserved in MS Vat – Ar. 636, which claims that <span><i>al-shaykh al-marḥūm</i></span> Daniel was the youngest of three scholars (the others being Yūsūf ibn Gharīb and Yashūʿ ibn Khayrūn) who revived church scholarship – and which then provides a list of Daniel’s works, mostly Arabic recensions made from the works of Barhebraeus, but including the original work <span><i>Kitāb uṣūl al-dīn</i></span>. Yashūʿ ibn Khayrūn and Yūsuf ibn Gharīb are both 14<span><sup>th</sup></span>-century figures (with death dates of 1335 and 1375 respectively, according to Barṣawm, <span><i>Al-luʾluʾ</i></span>, pp. 438-39, 441). According to this, the scholarly Daniel who wrote <span><i>Kitāb uṣūl al-dīn</i></span> is clearly a figure of the 14<span><sup>th</sup></span> century; there is little difficulty in identifying him with Daniel the confessor of Mardin in 1382. The question remains – and will not be settled here – of whether the name of this scholar and confessor of the faith was Daniel <span><i>ibn al-Khaṭṭāb</i></span> al-Mārdīnī, or whether the <span><i>nasab</i></span> found in several manuscripts is the result of a confusion with a writer of the 13<span><sup>th</sup></span> century.</p> <p>Summing up so far: the preserved biographical notices allow us to speak of the monk Daniel of Mardin, who devoted considerable scholarly energy to making Arabic-language recensions of writings of Barhebraeus (including the <span><i>Kitāb al-ishrāq</i></span>, which translates a number of chapters of Barhebraeus’ <span><i>Lamp of the sanctuary</i></span>; see Sepmeijer, ‘The book of brilliance’), but who also composed the original work <span><i>Kitāb uṣūl al-dīn</i></span> described below. Materials from this book – or perhaps from another, more sharply polemical work? – offended Muslim officials in Mardin, which was then under the rule of Sultan al-Malik al-Ṭāhir. Thus, in March 1382, Daniel was arrested, imprisoned, savagely beaten, urged to abandon his Christian faith, and finally paraded through the city by means of a rope tied to a ring through his nose. After he had spent several more weeks in prison, the Christian community paid a huge ransom for his release.</p> <p>According to Barṣawm (<span><i>Al-luʾluʾ</i></span>, p. 442, citing MS Berlin 23), Daniel was born in Mardin in 1327, became a monk and priest at Dayr al-Qaṭara, traveled to Egypt in search of knowledge in 1356, and returned to Mardin 17 years later.</p>",1

Al-Niffarī’s most characteristic contribution to mysticism is his doctrine of <span><i>waḳfa</i></span> <span><i>.</i></span> This term, which would appear to be used by him in a peculiarly technical sense, implies a condition in the mystic which is accompanied by direct divine audition, and perhaps even automatic script. <span><i>Mawḳif</i></span> is the name given to the state of the mystic in which <span><i>waḳfa</i></span> is classed higher than <span><i>maʿrifa</i></span> , and <span><i>maʿrifa</i></span> <a class=""page_break"" name=""P-V8p14"" title=""Section break: Volume VIII, Page 14, Column 1.

The <span><i>wāḳif</i></span> is nearer to God than any other thing, and almost transcends the condition of <span><i>bas̲h̲ariyya</i></span> , being alone separated from all limitation. Al-Niffarī definitely maintains the possibility of seeing God in this world; for he says that vision ( <span><i>ruʾya</i></span> ) in this world is a preparation for vision in the world to come. In several places, al-Niffarī distinctly touches on the theory of the Mahdī [<span><i>q.v.</i></span>], and indeed appears to identify himself with the Mahdī, if these passages are genuine; and this claim is seemingly in the mind of al-Zabīdī, when he describes al-Niffarī as <span><i>ṣāḥib al-daʿāwā wa ’l-ḍalāl</i></span> <span><i>.</i></span> Al-Tilimsānī, however, interprets these passages in an esoteric and highly mystical sense; and it does not accord with the general character of the author that he should make for himself such extravagant claims. Al-Niffarī shows himself in his writings to be a fearless and original thinker. While undoubtedly influenced by his great predecessor al-Ḥallād̲j̲ [<span><i>q.v.</i></span>], he acknowledges no obligations and has a thorough conviction of the reality of his own mission.",1

He got the education of a country squire of the time: <span><i>adab</i></span> , the Arabic language, chivalry ( <span><i>furūsiyya</i></span> ) and weaponry ( <span><i>istiʿmāl al-silāḥ</i></span> ). When as a young man he came to Naysābūr with the intention to get the taxes on one of his villages reduced, he became acquainted with the Ṣūfī <span><i>s̲h̲ayk̲h̲</i></span> Abū ʿAlī al-DaQQāQ, who became his master on the mystical path. Later on he married Abū ʿAlī’s daughter Fāṭima (born 391/1001).</p> <p>Besides his mystical exercises, he studied <span><i>fiQh</i></span> with the S̲h̲āfiʿī jurist Abū Bakr Muḥammad b.

In 436/1045 he issued a manifesto defending the orthodoxy of Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-As̲h̲ʿarī; the document (preserved by Ibn ʿAsākir, <span><i>Tabyīn</i></span> , 112-14; cf. Subkī, iii, 374 f.; Halm, <span><i>Der Wesir al-Kundurī</i></span> , 214 ff.) was signed by the most renowned S̲h̲āfiʿī scholars of the city. When in 446/1054 the Ḥanafī-S̲h̲āfiʿī conflict broke out into a violent <span><i>fitna</i></span> , al-Qushayrī was imprisoned by his adversaries, but was rescued some weeks later by his partisans by force of arms.

When the vizier Niẓām al-Mulk re-established the balance of power between the Ḥanafīs and the S̲h̲āfiʿīs, he returned to Naysābūr where he lived until his death.

He was born between 205/820 and 210/825, in Termez (Ar., Tirmidh), a commercial town in the old province of Khurāsān (in present-day Uzbekistan), on the border with Afghanistan. The most reliable information suggests 298/910 as his date of death, at more than ninety years old (Ibn Ḥajar, 5:310). Every year his mausoleum attracts throngs of pilgrims, which have increased since Uzbekistan became independent in 1991. The mausoleum is one of the monumental complexes of mediaeval Termez, which was built on the remains of an ancient city whose foundation dates back at least to the period of Alexander’s conquests (fourth-third centuries B.C.E.). It was usually part of the province of Bactria and part of Mā Warāʾ al-Nahr (lit., the country beyond the river river), located as it was on the right bank of the Amu Darya (Gk., Oxus; Ar., Jayḥūn) at the confluence with the Surkhan (Uzbek, Surxondaryo) Darya, in present-day southern Uzbekistan.",1
39,Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī,أبو طالب المكي,Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī,أبو طالب المكري,386,"Ohlander, Erik S., “al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmidhī”, in: <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE</i>, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Devin J.","<span><b>Abū Ṭālib</b></span> Muḥammad b. ʿAlī b. ʿAṭiyya al-Ḥārithī al-ʿAjamī <span><b>al-Makkī</b></span> (d. 386/996) was an ascetic, a Ṣūfī, a preacher, and author of the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb fī muʿāmalat al-maḥbūb wa-waṣf ṭarīq al-murīd ilā maqām al-tawḥīd</i></span> (“Nourishment of the hearts in relations with the beloved and a description of the path of the aspirant to the station of divine unicity”), an encyclopaedic manual of Ṣūfī piety that influenced a number of notable Ṣūfīs of subsequent generations. Born into a family hailing from the province of al-Jibāl (ancient Media), al-Makkī grew up in Mecca, where he attached himself to Abū Saʿīd al-Aʿrābī (d. 341/952), a Ṣūfī of Basran origin and himself a student of the great Ṣūfī theoretician and exponent of “sober” Ṣūfism, al-Junayd (d. 298/910) of Baghdad. In addition to al-Aʿrābī, al-Makkī cites ʿĀbid al-Shaṭṭ Muẓaffar b. Sahl and Abū ʿAlī al-Kirmānī as his masters in Mecca (al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, 34.127, 47.17), but little is known about either. He also heard <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span> from ʿAbdallāh b. Jaʿfar b. Fāris al-Iṣfahānī (d. 346/957) and, possibly later, in Baghdad, he heard the <span><i>Ṣaḥīḥ</i></span> (“The sound”) of the famous traditionist al-Bukhārī (d. 256/870), as transmitted by Abū Zayd al-Marwazī (d. 371/982), a traditionist of the Shāfiʿī school. At some point al-Makkī left for Iraq, settling in the city of Basra for a time before eventually making his way to Baghdad, where he died in Jumādā II 386/June 996, finding his final resting place in the city's cemetery for followers of the Mālikī school.</p> <p>The exact dates of al-Makkī's movements are unknown, although an autobiographical passage in the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span> finds him still in Mecca in 330/941–2 (al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, 31.175). A report cited by the historian al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī (d. 463/1071) on the testimony of the Baghdadi preacher Ibn al-ʿAllāf (d. 442/1050) states that al-Makkī arrived in Basra after the death of the Ṣūfī, theologian, and preacher Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Sālim—who died between 350/961 and 360/971, or, according to Ibn al-Athīr, in 356/967—and that he then represented himself as a follower of Ibn Sālim's teachings (al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, 3:89). This report, however, is contradicted by al-Makkī's own claim that he in fact saw Ibn Sālim in person during his lifetime (al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, 34.7, 36.19). Many of al-Makkī's biographers—see, for example, al-Dhahabī, <span><i>al-ʿIbar</i></span>, 3:34; al-Yāfiʿī, 2:430; al-ʿAsqalānī, 5:300—make a point of mentioning his close association with the Sālimiyya, a mystical theological school associated with Muḥammad b. Sālim (d. 297/909) and his son, the aforementioned Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Sālim, both former disciples of the noted Basran mystic Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283/896) and pre-eminent heirs to his teachings (Böwering, 89–99). Indeed, extensive references in the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span> evince al-Makkī's indebtedness to the Tustarī-Sālimiyya tradition (al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, index: 71, 207–9,), and since no works of Muḥammad b. Sālim or Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Sālim survive, this is at present the only reliable source for their teachings. However, the exact nature of the connection is unclear and requires further study (see Gramlich intro., al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, 1:15–6).</p> <p>Perhaps inspired by the practices of the Sālimiyya, al-Makkī gained a reputation for asceticism, for a time consuming nothing but wild herbs, until his skin took on a green tinge (Ibn Khallikān, 4:303). Upon his arrival in Baghdad, he set himself up as a preacher, although he quickly drew the ire of his audience, one statement in particular eliciting sharp condemnation: “There is nothing more harmful to creatures than the creator” (<span><i>laysa ʿalā l-makhlūqīn aḍarr min al-khāliq;</i></span> al-Ṣafadī, 4:116). The significance of this report is unclear but is likely rooted in the early anathematisation of the Sālimiyya. He subsequently renounced public preaching and retired into seclusion.</p> <p>Little is known about al-Makkī's later years, although he is reported to have frequented the circles of certain Baghdadi traditionists and Ṣūfīs, including ʿAlī b. Aḥmad al-Miṣṣīṣī (d. 364/974–5), who also transmitted <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span> to the great Shāfiʿī scholar and Ṣūfī biographer Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī (d. 430/1038), and Abū Bakr al-Mufīd al-Jarjarāʾī (d. 378/988), a traditionist who is said to have associated with al-Junayd as a boy (al-Anṣārī, <span><i>Ṭabaqāt al-Ṣūfiyya</i></span>, ed. Muḥammad Sarvar Mawlāʾī (Tehran 1362sh/1983), 508; Jāmī, 201, 349). It is also reported that al-Makkī fathered a son, ʿUmar b. Muḥammad b. ʿAlī (d. 445/1053), and that he transmitted <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span> to the Baghdadi traditionist and author ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Azajī (d. 444/1052).</p> <p>Al-Makkī's fame derives primarily from his <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span>, a sizable treatise divided into forty-eight chapters of varying length, structured in such a way as to constitute a systematic compendium of Ṣūfī piety and practice that, in the style of a manual of jurisprudence, covers acts of worship, the nature of the human psycho-spiritual constitution and its disciplining, theological issues, the stations and states of the Ṣūfī path, and various practical and social matters, with every case presented in such a way so as to elucidate the subtle inner meanings of each action or topic under discussion. Abstruse in parts, as a whole the text is infused with a guarded conservatism, the author apologetically rejecting what he sees as innovation, speculative fancy, and mystical excess in favour of the Qurʾān, <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>, and especially the exempla of the Ṣūfī paragons of the past. Although later criticised by the prominent Ḥanbalī scholar of Baghdad Ibn al-Jawzī (d. 597/1200) for relying upon weak traditions (Ibn al-Jawzī, 7:189), al-Makkī takes pains to inform his readers that he chose to follow the practice of Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 241/855), the eponym of the Ḥanbalīs, in preferring a weak <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span> over the use of reasoning based on <span><i>raʾy</i></span> (personal opinion) and <span><i>qiyāṣ</i></span> -(analogy) (al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, 31.233–42).</p> <p>Apparently unknown to the Ṣūfī authorities of the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries, the earliest reference to the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span> outside the prosopography is by the outstanding theologian, jurist, original thinker, mystic, and religious reformer Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111), who mentions it among the works to which he turned for information on Ṣūfism (<span><i>al-Munqidh min al-ḍalāl</i></span>, ed. ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm Maḥmūd (Cairo 1964), 59); indeed, al-Ghazālī's <span><i>Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn</i></span> (“The revivification of the religious sciences”) displays a significant reliance upon al-Makkī's text (see K. Nakamura, Makkī and Ghazālī on mystical practices, <span><i>Orient</i></span> 20 (1984), 83–91). Much the same can be said for the influential Ṣūfī master of Baghdad ʿUmar al-Suhrawardī (d. 632/1234), who not only considered al-Makkī an authority on Ṣūfism, but often quotes and paraphrases the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span> in his own Ṣūfī handbook, the <span><i>ʿAwārif al-maʿārif</i></span> (“Benefits of intimate knowledge”). It is telling that copies of the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span> found a place alongside the <span><i>ʿAwārif</i></span> in the <span><i>khānqāh</i></span> (“hospice”) libraries of al-Suhrawardī's disciples and their successors in Iraq and Syria (Ibn al-Mustawfī, <span><i>Taʾrīkh Irbil</i></span>, ed. Sāmī b. al-Sayyid al-Ṣaqqār (Baghdad 1980), 1:258–9; al-Ṣafadī, 4:116). The <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span> likewise gained popularity among members of the early Shādhiliyya Ṣūfī brotherhood in Egypt and North Africa (Ibn ʿAṭāʾallāh, <span><i>Laṭāʾif al-minan</i></span>, ed. ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm Maḥmūd (Cairo 1974), 19–20, 179–80), with Ibn ʿAbbād al-Rundī (d. 792/1390) finding it to be a particularly profound work (<span><i>al-Rasāʾil al-ṣughrā</i></span>, ed. Paul Nwyia (Beirut 1974), index), as did the great Persian Ṣūfī settled in Konya, Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī (d. 672/1273), over a century earlier (<span><i>Mathnawī-yi maʿnawī</i></span>, ed. Reynold A. Nicholson (Tehran 1371Sh/1957), 1172 (bk. 6, l.2653)). A number of early extracts and commentaries on the text are also extant (<span><i>GAS</i></span> 1:667).</p> <p>In addition to the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span>, al-Makkī is reported to have authored other works, although they are all either spurious or have not survived. Al-Makkī's <span><i>ʿIlm al-qulūb</i></span> (“Science of the hearts”; ed. ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad ʿAṭāʾ, Cairo 1384/1964) is a treatise about a quarter the length of the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span>, whose focus and content is decidedly more esoteric and recondite, devoted mainly to explicating Ṣūfī concepts and technical terminology. Gramlich has argued, on the basis of a number of internal features—not the least of which is the fact that al-Makkī is quoted in the third person in a number of places—that it was composed by a follower (see Gramlich intro., al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, 1:20; but cf. ʿAṭāʾ's comments in al-Makkī, <span><i>ʿIlm al-qulūb</i></span>, 291–4). Although attributed to al-Makkī by Carl Brockelmann because of a reference in an epistle of the aforementioned al-Rundī (<span><i>GAL</i></span> 1:217), al-Makkī's <span><i>al-Bayān al-shāfī</i></span> (“The decisive explanation”) is not, it transpires, a discrete work, but rather simply a bibliographical error resulting from a grammatically confusing reference (al-Rundī, 19).</p> <p>Al-Makkī also produced a collection of forty <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>, compiled from among those transmitted to him by al-Iṣfahānī—who granted him an <span><i>ijāza</i></span> (authorisation to transmit <span><i>ḥadīth</i></span>)—and al-Marwazī. Although this collection is not extant, it is documented by al-Dhahabī (d. 748/1348 or 753/1352–3), who reports seeing a copy of the text in the author's handwriting (al-Dhahabī, <span><i>Siyar</i></span>, 16:537; al-Dhahabī, <span><i>Taʾrīkh</i></span>, 19:128). Also lost is the <span><i>Kitāb manāsik al-ḥajj</i></span> (“Book of the rites of the pilgrimage”), a work mentioned by al-Makkī in the <span><i>Qūt al-qulūb</i></span> (al-Makkī, <span><i>Die Nahrung</i></span>, 34.92), and perhaps the source for ʿUmar al-Suhrawardī's <span><i>Ḥilyat al-nāsik fī l-manāsik</i></span> (“Ornament of the devotee in the rites of the pilgrimage”; Istanbul, Süleymaniye Library, MS Ayasofya 11363, fols. 98b–121b).</p> ",1

His father Abū Manṣūr, a shopkeeper, had spent several years of his youth at Balḵ, first in the service of a Hanbalite ascetic, Abu’l-Moẓaffar Ḥabbāl Termeḏī, then with Šarīf Ḥamza ʿAqīlī and his Sufi companions of the Baghdad tradition. Abū Manṣūr exercised a considerable influence on his son through his own example (a life dominated by <em>waraʿ</em>, scruple), his associates (the Sufis from the Kohandez), and the care he took over his early education.</p> <p>ʿAbdallāh attended school from the age of four. When he was nine, he wrote down the Hadith as dictated by two eminent traditionists, Abū Manṣūr Azdī and Abu’l-Fażl Jārūdī. Probably soon after, a crisis occurred. Abū Manṣūr, worn out by the worries of daily existence and nostalgic for the masters of his youth, abandoned shop and family and returned to Balḵ, where he died in 430/1039. Two people then took charge of the orphan—Yaḥyā b. ʿAmmār Šaybānī, a celebrated and extremely rich master with whom he began to study exegesis, and Shaikh ʿAmmū, a well-traveled Sufi who was a disciple of Abu’l-ʿAbbās Nehāvandī. He had built and financed a mosque with an adjoining <em>ḵānaqāh</em> at Gāzorgāh, a few kilometers north of Herat.</p> <p>At the age of fourteen, ʿAbdallāh was admitted by his masters to their gatherings. Yaḥyā b. ʿAmmār designated him as his successor. Besides his master’s virulence in polemics, ʿAbdallāh inherited his manner of slowly commenting on the Koran with numerous long digressions, and also his taste for decorum at meetings. Probably in the same period, ʿAbdallāh met Moḥammad Ṭāqī Seǰestānī, a Hanbalite Sufi. If Shaikh ʿAmmū and Abu’l-Ḥasan Bešrī Seǰzī taught him about the masters they had frequented, it was Ṭāqī who penetrated the secret of his heart. To Ṭāqī he owed his profound knowledge of the Hanbalite doctrine and his indifference toward the powerful and the rich. The death of this “spy of hearts” was probably behind ʿAbdallāh’s decision to go to Nīšāpūr in 417/1026 to study the Hadith and the Law, and to meet the shaikhs there. In a few months of hard work, he took maximum advantage of the teachings of the old disciples of Abu’l-ʿAbbās Moḥammad b. Yaʿqūb al-Aṣamm. However, he refused to record the traditions transmitted by Abū Bakr Ḥīrī and others, because of their Asḥʿarite opinions.</p> <p>On returning to Herat, ʿAbdallāh joined the traditionist circles there again. In 422/1031, Yaḥyā b. ʿAmmār, the last of his childhood masters, died. Sultan Maḥmūd’s death and the advent of his son Masʿūd caused anxiety in Herat, where the latter had been governor. When Masʿūd demanded that the caliph reopen the pilgrim route, ʿAbdallāh offered to accompany the old Imam Abu’l-Fażl b. Saʿd to Mecca. The caravan reached Baghdad without mishap, but news of unsafe roads made them decide to return to Khorasan. The following year (424/1033), ʿAbdallāh tried again. At Nīšāpūr, he stopped at Ebn Bākū’s <em>ḵānaqāh</em>, where he met <a href=""/articles/abu-said-fazlallah-b"">Abū Saʿīd b. Abu’l-Ḵayr</a>. This time the caravan was unable to go farther than Ray. On the return journey, he met Moḥammad Qassāb Āmolī at Dāmḡān. But the encounter which marked his life permanently was with Abu’l-Ḥasan Ḵaraqānī, an illiterate, aging Sufi who claimed to be the spiritual heir of Bāyazīd Besṭāmī. Like Ṭāqī, the old man could read into his heart and answered even his unformulated questions. Anṣārī said: “If I hadn’t met Ḵaraqānī, I would never have known Reality. He continually mingled this and that, that is to say the self and Reality” (Jāmī, <em>Nafaḥāt</em>, p. 336). Ḵaraqānī had taught him that God was just as likely to be in Khorasan as in Ḥeǰāz. So it was better to follow Ebn Bākū’s advice: Gather disciples and tell them about Him. He began as a master in the Kohandez. The influence of Ḵaraqānī’s ideas on him is exemplified by an anecdote in which he settles the question of superiority of <em>morīd</em> or of <em>morād</em> by paradox. “There is neither <em>morīd</em> or <em>morād</em>, neither received information nor request, nor definition, no description! He (God) is everything” (ibid., p. 34). Some of his followers such as Esmāʿīl and Aḥmad Ḵaštī were experienced Sufis. One of them took him in the winter of 425/early 1034 to Nobāḏān south of Herat to a gathering of sixty-two well-known shaikhs. Although only twenty-eight, ʿAbdallāh was admired by his elders and was lavished with gifts and invitations. However, an incident after a session of <em>samāʿ</em> broke the charm. Taking only his prayer rug, he returned hurriedly to Herat. For ten years he taught only the Hadith, taking the “innovators” to task, Asḥʿarites as well as Muʿtazilites. In 430/1038, he was denounced for anthropomorphism and appeared before Sultan Masʿūd who, satisfied with his reply, released him with marks of esteem.</p> <p>Anṣārī’s enemies, however, did not give in. Shortly after the fall of Masʿūd and the invasion by the Saljuqs, an assembly of theologians and notables forbade him to teach. He exiled himself to Šakīvān, where he remained from 433/1041 to 435/1043. On his return, he changed his methods. He undertook a commentary on the Koran and the following year started it again from the beginning, but the work was never finished.</p> <p>In 438/1046-47 another assembly made a report against him. Anṣārī was expelled from the city and imprisoned at Pūšanǰ for six months. After this ordeal he took up his commentary again and lingered over the Koranic verse “Those who believe are the most ardent in their love of God” (2:160-65); his teaching became more spiritual and less polemical. His persecutors allowed him some respite, but with Shaikh ʿAmmū’s death in 441/1049 he lost a discreet and generous protector. Anṣārī came to know extreme poverty, although he made an effort to keep up appearances.</p> <p>In 445/1053, Sultan Toḡrel Beg, urged by his secretary Abū Naṣr Kondorī, started persecuting the Asḥʿarites. Anṣārī’s principal enemies were reduced to silence, exposed to imprisonment or exile. So he won peace and growing renown. Eminent people, such as Abu’l-Ḥasan Bāḵarzī and Abu’l-Qāsem Zūzanī al-Bāreʿ, visited him and were amazed by his talents as a preacher and interpreter of the Koran. His material situation, too, improved thanks to gifts made to him. The new Hanafite judge, Abu’l-ʿAlāʾ Ṣāʿed b. Sayyār, offered him a place to preach in the mosque, where he continued to comment on the Koran. An unsuccessful approach was made to Alp Arslān at the end of 450/1059 to prohibit Anṣārī’s meetings. So he lived in peace until the death of Toḡrel Beg and the replacement of Kondorī by Neẓām-al-molk as the new sultan’s vizier.</p> <p>In 456/1064, all the anti-Asḥʿarite measures were annulled. Anṣārī’s enemies tried to silence this cumbersome preacher by all possible means. They wanted to provoke a discussion with him in front of Alp Arslān and his vizier, but Anṣārī rejected all arguments other than the Koran and the Sunna. When Anṣārī again took up polemics, his enemies secured an expulsion order from the vizier Neẓām-al-molk, who was in Marv in 458/1066. After a brief exile in Balḵ, Anṣārī returned. Several other attempts on the part of his opponents and their recourse to the sultan and his vizier proved counter-productive and Anṣārī emerged triumphant. Soon after 462/1069 the master’s triumph was consecrated, when Caliph al-Qāʾem offered him a robe of honor at the instigation of Neẓām-al-molk, who wished to win the sympathy of the traditionists. Then began a glorious apogee of a long career, which lasted eleven years. Anṣārī continued preaching at the mosque, secure with regard of those in power and venerated by the population. In his <em>ḵānaqāh</em> he perfected the training of a few intimate friends such as Abu’l-Ḵayr ʿAbdallāh b. Marzūq (a slave he had freed), Abū Naṣr al-Moʿtamen Sāǰī, and Moḥammad b. Ṭāher Maqdesī.</p> <p>In 437/1080-81, Anṣārī went blind. This hardship was lightened by the tender care of his secretary, Ḥosayn Kotobī, who was to be the faithful companion of his last exile. His intimate circle was renewed, and his dictations were written down by adolescents and even children: Abu’l-Vaqt ʿAbd-al-Avval Seǰzī his <em>ḵādem</em>, Abu’l-Fatḥ ʿAbd-al-Malek Karūḵī, and Abū Jaʿfar Moḥammad Ṣaydalānī. In 474/1082, Caliph al-Moqtadī repeated his predecessor’s gesture and sent a sumptuous robe of honor to one whom he called Šayḵ-al-eslām, Šayḵ-al-šoyūḵ, and Zayn-al-ʿolamāʾ. Feeling his strength diminish, Anṣārī doubled his activities and now dictated his main works. This extensive activity was interrupted by the coming of a philosophizing theologian (<em>motakallem motafalsef</em>) to Herat in Ramażān, 478. Anṣārī censored him with his customary violence, and a group of his partisans burnt down the man’s house and beat him black and blue. The leading citizens decided to expel those responsible immediately. On 20 Ramażān/12 January 1086, the group left the city for Pūšanǰ—exactly where the theologian himself had taken refuge! There was a fight at the Neẓāmīya school, which was consequently closed, and a report was made to the sultan. Two months later, Anṣārī was told to go to Transoxania. The group went via Nīšāpūr toward Marv. There an order from Neẓām-al-molk instructed him to go to Balḵ, where he was welcomed. In autumn the group was ordered to go to Marv-al-rūd, where they spent the winter. In spring they were allowed to return home, and were given a triumphal welcome at Herat, on 21 April 1087.</p> <p>As the end approached, Anṣārī pressed on with his commentary on the Koran. He died on Friday, 22 Ḏu’l-ḥeǰǰa 481/8 March 1089. He was buried on a rainy day at Gāzorgāh, near the <em>ḵānaqāh</em> and the tomb of Shaikh ʿAmmū.</p> <p>Anṣārī was not a writer, but a teacher and an orator. It was only at the end of his life, when urged by disciples and forced by polemics, that he resolved to dictate his main works. His nervous, essentially oral style, where assonance and rhythm interrelate and where his thought defines itself by successive waves, struck his contemporaries and successors as a sort of snowballing. He is an equally difficult author in either Arabic or Persian. His main works are the following: 1. <em>Ketāb-e ṣad maydān</em> (“Book of the hundred arenas”; ed. in <em>Mélanges Islamologiques</em> 2, 1954, pp. 1-90). These are notes taken by a disciple during Anṣārī’s gatherings in 448/1056-57. In connection with Koran 3:29-31, the master makes an exposition of the spiritual itinerary in a hundred small chapters. The advance towards God coincides with the growing of love, which is first rightness (<em>rāstī</em>), then intoxication (<em>mastī</em>), and finally annihilation (<em>nīstī</em>). 2. <em>Ketāb ḏamm al-kalām wa ahleh</em> (“Condemnation of <em>kalām</em> and those who practice it”; B.M. Add. 27520; Damascus, Omayyad. 24/587; Ankara, Üniv. Ilahiyat Fak. Kütüp. 7614/1-2), a substantial polemical work, almost entirely composed of quotations with isnads, not yet published. It comprises two parts, each of fifteen chapters. In the first the author endeavors to prove that the Prophet has foreseen and condemned all the theologians’ activities. In the second, he attempts to show that all imams who are recognized authorities in Islam disapproved of these activities. By way of conclusion, a few chapters treat the malediction of theologians and the sin of accepting learning from them, and the greatness of those who live according to the Sunna. The last chapter, on the doctrine of al-Ašʿarī, gives a fair idea of his virulence as a polemist.</p> <p>3. <em>Ketāb manāzel al-sāʾerīn</em> (“Book of the itinerants’ stages”; ed. and tr., Cairo, 1962; Pers. tr. and notes by ʿA. Ḡ. Ravān Farhādī, Kabul, 1976). This small book, which was written in response to his disciples’ entreaties, made Anṣārī’s renown in the history of Sufism; numerous commentaries on it are known. It is an itinerary of the soul’s journey towards God comprising ten sections on the ten stages, each defined, then analyzed according to three degrees of realization. Designed for easy memorization, the rigidity of its structure is understandable. Anṣārī’s thought remains very simple respecting each person’s progress through the main stages of spiritual life. The comparison with the <em>Ketāb-e ṣad maydān</em> is enlightening: It is <em>tawḥīd</em>, and no longer love, which polarizes the attention up to the highest summits of mystical life, where it is God himself who ineffably radiates his own <em>tawḥīd</em> into the hearts of his chosen ones.</p> <p>4. <em>Ṭabaqāt al-ṣūfīya</em> (“Generations of Sufis”; ed. ʿAbd-al-Ḥayy Ḥabībī, Kabul, 1961): This substantial work provides us with the notes taken by a disciple during gatherings, probably at the <em>ḵānaqāh</em> where Anṣārī spoke very freely about the Sufis who had preceded him. Jāmī considers this work as a commentary on Solamī’s <em>Ṭabaqāt</em>, relieved of its isnads and completed by Anṣārī. Perhaps Anṣārī did find inspiration in his predecessor; however, he achieved a work very much his own. In addition to the biographical information and the quoted maxims, there are personal judgments, excursuses, poems and <em>monāǰāt</em>s, all written in the old language of Herat. Four centuries later, Jāmī took up the substance, updating the language, cutting down the excursuses and the difficult passages. The result was <em>Nafaḥāt al-ons</em>. 5. <em>Ketāb ʿelal al-maqāmāt</em> (“Book of the deficiencies inherent in the stages”; ed. and tr. in <em>Mélanges Massignon </em> I, Damascus, 1956, pp. 153-71). This short treatise was written just before Anṣārī’s death, probably in reply to a question from Karūḵī concerning one of the last sentences of the <em>Manāzel</em>. With regard to the ten stages (of which love is one), it shows how all the spiritual states, except <em>tawḥīd</em>, have deficiencies. 6. The <em>Mosaǰǰaʿāt</em>, a collection of invocations, reflections, and advice with various titles and contents. Unfortunately when these are compared with those quoted in the <em>Ṭabaqāt</em> or in Maybodī’s <em>Kašf al-asrār</em>, it is difficult to imagine that they have one and the same author. Without denying them a considerable intrinsic value, one must be wary concerning their authenticity. As regards other works by Anṣārī, there exist only titles mentioned by him or by his biographers or short quoted extracts. The <em>Moḵtaṣar fī ādāb al-ṣūfīya</em>, published in <em>BIFAO</em> 59, 1960, pp. 203-69, has now been proved to belong to another author.</p> <p>Anṣārī gives the impression of a strong personality endowed with exceptional talent and uncompromisingly faithful to the Hanbalite doctrine which he always defended with ardor. He was a spiritual master very much aware of the Sufi tradition but always personal in his judgments. Because of his education, Hanbalism and Sufism exist harmoniously in his mind rather than confronting each other. His spiritual development was marked by his encounters and trials. Ḵaraqānī’s message on Reality, at first leading towards a mystique of intoxication, is reinterpreted according to a mystique of love, then according to a mystique of unification (<em>tawḥīd</em>). Anṣārī was no longer searching for the coming out of the self (<em>bī-ḵᵛodī</em>); all that mattered for him was the discovery of the Self (<em>ḵᵛod</em>) in the depth of the heart.</p> <p>His attitude to the great masters of the Baghdad school, from which he claimed descent, was original. In his opinion, Abū Saʿīd Ḵarrāz (286/899) was by far the most eminent. He preferred a hair from Rovaym to a hundred Jonayds. Finally, he suspended judgment on Ḥallāǰ, not because he contested his experience, but because he did not approve of his having betrayed God’s secret; he considered Ḥallāǰ’s execution as the consequence and the punishment. Lastly, as concerns the more recent Sufis, Anṣārī estimated that ten names should be given a special place: Abu’l-Ḵayr Tīnātī, Qarafī, Ḥoṣrī, ʿAlī Bondār Ṣayrafī, Naṣrābādī, Šīrvānī the younger, Nevāhandī, Qaṣṣāb, Ḵaraqānī, and Ṭāqī.</p>",1
